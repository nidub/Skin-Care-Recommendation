       "'Unfortunately this doesnt work for everyone I used it once and woke up the nxt day with 5 pimples used it again and again and again but woke up with more and more Finally i couldnt take it anymore I stopped using it went back to my cerave hydrating cleanser and Bam My skin was clearing up every day after that I suggest getting the small bottle to try it out first Remember everyones skin is very different\\nread more There is nothing great about this cleanser I got the small size bottle to try out and would certainly never spend my money to buy this It did remove my makeup so this got 2 stars instead of one but it did nothing for my skin In fact I had some uneven texture after using this for a while There are much better cleansers out there Been trying this cleanser for about 3 weeks now and its not for me Im so glad I only bought the small bottle as this product broke me out Its the only new product in my routine so I know it is this one causing the break outs I also just didnt feel as though it cleanses very well anyway Just a waste of money tbh And now I have breakouts around my nose and my chin to deal with great Best cleaner Ive ever used Gets my face nice and clean without stripping my face My only con is the packing due to the cleanser leaking from the nozzle There are Pros and Cons to this cleanser This cleaner I believe is a game changer for someone who needs a morning cleanser or someone who is a no makeup  light makeup person but if your someone like me who is a medium  heavy makeup person then this is not for you It barely removes your makeup you use way too much when washing your face and you end up not feeling like your face is fully cleaned\\nread more This product smells good the glass bottle and pump are great and it does a great job at removing makeup I took a star off because its not meshing well with my dry winter skin Unfortunately this doesnt work for everyone I used it once and woke up the nxt day with 5 pimples used it again

This product smells good the glass bottle and pump are great and it does a great job at removing makeup I took a star off because its not meshing well with my dry winter skin I have sensitive skin and grabbed these while traveling as a quick fix I found it to be very painful and lacking I dont recommend them for combination sensitive skin types Stick with Neutrogena Very disappointed with these Wipes were too dry to clean up make up It was like using a mildly damp Kleenex Pass I bought these on accident I normally get the bamboo ones because I enjoy the exfoliating sidehoweverwhile the scent is my least favorite thing about this particular wipe I have to say I love the way it leaves my skin after I use it Not dry not oily no residuejust right 4 stars only because of the scent I love the scents of these wipes Opening the package gives me a sense of joy each time These wipes dont remove all of my makeup plus it feels like a film is left on my face but I only use them for traveling so its not a big deal One side is VERY HARSH and the other is very soft Make sure you are using the soft side on your face as the scrubbing side I found was very hard on my skin Consistently excellent takes off my makeup really easily no oily residue is left behind and the smell of the Aloe is very soothing I use as a regular face wipe just as often as I use it as a makeup remover Sensitive skin types beware as it is a bit harsher than some makeup wipes Oily skin types rejoice at a moisturizing wipe with no residue Only issue I have is with the harsh side I wish it were a bit softer\\nread more I like these wipes a lot Theyre not overly fragrant effectively take off my makeup before yoga or before I wash my face and dont break me out Theyre not cheap but best Ive tried I found the abrasive side if these wipes to be too harsh The scent was nice and they did their job but they werent anything special There are definitely better wipes out there Removes makeup well but when I was taking off mascara it caused my eyes to sting so I dont not recommend it for sensitive areas of the face They work pretty well but be careful because the exfoliating side is VERY harsh Dont press too much or you will seriously irritate your skin Great product I like that its twosided One for exfoliating and the other for a gentler cleanse Be sure to hydrate after They dont hold much moisture and it takes several to remove any makeup it made my skin break out Cleaned my face great while on travels My husband also loved them It smells pretty good and the quantity is fairly reasonable However I think that you need to go over your face multiple times to get a full face of makeup off I would suggest storing them upsidedown to get more moisture into each wipe The price is really good I really love this product but my bestie and I both got these at the same time and she got 4 samples of the same wipes for free and didnt have to pay at all and then I had to pay for the whole packed of wipes like really come on Takes the make up off of course but it hurts my face for days even if I gently clean my face It HURTS Lol I only used several wipes threw the rest away  I have sensitive skin and

grail of mine I use to use up so much though because I needed a lot to keep the breakouts at bay I would recommend for someone with less oily skin than mine Very bad ingredients I had a sample of this and did not like it when I read the ingredients I was shocked that anyone would use this when we now know so much more about good and bad ingredients Sulfates parabensirritating oils and alcohol are not something we should be using on our face Great cleanser Smells nice and not too strong I deducted a star because for it to be an expensive face wash it should have been made without sulfates and parabens Ive used Philosophy shampoo and conditioners and absolutely loved them so I figured I would turn to them when I needed a new cleanser Unfortunately I could not get past the horrible perfumey smell Im not sensitive to scents at all but this is brutal I couldnt use it enough to see any longterm effect on my skin so I cant speak to that I would suggest getting the smallest version if you want to try it Avoid if you are scentsensitive\\nread more Not sure why everyone loves this stuff I have dry skin and I didnt find it to help much I dont care for the smell of it either  hard to describe but almost smells really chemical like crossed with a stinky perfume Not sure Also it took a lot of product to get a good lather I like my face washes to be really foamy but this just didnt do it for me I wouldnt recommend  if you are looking for a good cleanser that is safe for sensitive dry skin Id try the Origins checks and balances frothy face wash Im the type to always want to try different products but this face wash is the BEST I keep reaching for it over everything else Forget philosophy and go with Origins\\nread more My daughter and I have tried countless cleansers and so far we keep coming back to purity It helps keep are faces clear and helps reduce my pores I used to love this but I found my skin starting to break out Not sure if they changed the formula or not

to break out Not sure if they changed the formula or not Great for taking off make up though I usually like drunk elephant products but this one was not good It broke my boyfriends skin and mine out almost immediately i have very good and unproblematic skin too Plus it says its a jelly cleanser but it foams up big no no Im just going to stick with my Fresh Soy Cleanser I got a sample of this for my free birthday gift I think It took me a little while to want to use it since I had used another Drunk Elephant product that my skin did not like I went on a trip which normally causes me to break out I took this mini with me for convenience I ended up not breaking out at all Not even a little bit When I got home I kept using the mini alternately with my Boscia cleanser My skin looked and felt great I ended up ordering a full size I still use it alternately with my other cleanser I like how soft my face feels after I use this cleanser It seems pretty gentle so if you have sensitive skin this might be a worthwhile try\\nread more I got this as a sample for my birthday I wasnt willing to pay 60 dollars for the moisturizer but I did find this cleanser great It isnt stripping unless you dont moisturize which you should always do anyway If I wash my face with this at night I typically only have to rinse my face in the morning before the rest of my routine Theres a lot of product in there so the price makes sense I reccomend I wasnt a fan of this product I didnt feel like it cleaned my face the way a cleanser should I love DE products but this one is not for me I have broken out since I started using it in a way I have never experienced before Redness whiteheads and irritation Cant recommend this cleanser This is a nice basic cleanser not stripping and removes most of my makeup However this did not remove my waterproof and nonwaterproof mascaras and sometimes would sting if too much was lathered around my eyes Not a complete face washing routine for me since I needed something else to finish the job I could see this being too drying in the winter for some people but I found it very mild Overall it was ok My skin felt good my red scarring seemed to go down and I think I even produced less oil Downside was I broke out with these tiny white heads which I didnt have before They didnt take too long to heal but they just kept coming Broke me out every time I tried it Do not recommend I wanted to love this because I do really like all the other DE products but this cleanser dries out my skin Really struggled to finish it Feels good I received a sample of this but it didnt blow my mind now that Im using it daily I do feel like it cleans my skin and is moisturizing Price point seems comparable to other gentle cleansers I would buy it again Got this as a sample from Sephora It severely dries out my skin so much that I threw it in the garbage DE products make me break out and dry me outoverhyped brand I really liked this cleanser in the beginning but after some time it started to really irritate my skin My face would feel itchy and sting I stopped using this for a while and tried it again when my face returned to normal This definitely causing my

found that it sometimes burns my sensitive skin especially while going over areas of acnedermatitis I have found the fresh toner to be gentle enough for my skin even through its rough stages  has

toner it is hydrating you can tell that its doing a good job removing excess oil and balancing my skin It smells wonderful I love everything I have tried from Fresh and I do highly recommend this it should work for most skin types but try the small bottle first What I dont love is the stupid rose petals inside yes they are pretty but they pack them in there and they completely clog the bottle as

its very good at taking your makeup off especially mascaraeye makeup I use it mainly for my eye makeup but afterwards it leaves a weird fog over your eyes for a minute or so and makes your eyes water a lot after using it I wont be purchasing it again for that reason The cleansing balm certainly removes all makeup and oil from skin but definitely uneases the eyes to some extent I prefer the original liquid formula The balm smells bad and doesnt remove my mascara as good as the original Id give it 5 stars if it didnt contain plastic Polyethylene Unfortunately when it goes down the drain it contributes to the plastic contamination of our waterways because our sewage systems have not been designed to filter out the microbeads  As soon as Ive finished the last jar in my stash Ill be looking for an alternative Got rid of the makeup immediately Definitely got the balm in my eyes didnt sting but obviously want to avoid this next time Got a sample of this as a reward Most likely will buy it I love that this is one of the only cleansing balms on the market that has zero fragrance or essential oils Great for sensitive skin but it has polyethylene which is melting plastic

years and I keep coming back to this one Luxury balms are usually the same quality with similar ingredientsthey simply have added fragrance and a much higher price tag The only thing that keeps this

works and dont irritate eyes I remove 1 star because its expensive A good product for sensitive eyes A little oily but fabulous for eye makeup removal So gentle no pulling or tugging necessary I would recommend this to anyone with sensitive eyes or aging skin I came in for the Clinique product which was sold out and the consultant sold me this instead saying it was equivalent This is slot heavier and oily  would be great for eye make up removal rather than full face I will still need to buy the Clinique product and this will probably sit for a few years in my cupboard Its a good makeup remover no issues You dont need to use a lot What I dont like about it is the slippery oily digusting film it leaves over my face It takes a while to scrub the oilyness off after using it I just use makeup wipes now and they work just as good for way cheaper too lol I dont mind paying the money but when something feels greasy never again It works and dont irritate eyes I remove 1 star because its

asked if she uses the kit She said she doesnt any more Just this bottle Her face looked nice and oilshine free So I purchased the kit I used the products faithfully and after two weeks my face started to break out and my shine was never reduced I stopped using the toner and kept using the other two bottles for 2 more weeks After those 2 weeks my face looked horrible and was very irritated I had pimples and cysts that would not go away I had to stop using the products I could barely use foundation Anything that touch my face made it feel like it was on fire I had to go to a dermatologist and be prescribed doxycycline and a retinoid cream After 3 months of that regimen the pimples and cysts went away Then I ran into two fellow nurses who tried this product and broke out and were prescribed doxycycline as well Dont do it ladies and gents Theres better products out to maintain an acne free face\\nread more I bought this when out of nowhere my complexion was getting funky It totally cleared it up quickly My only issue is that if I use it in the morning after I wash my face in the shower it turns my skin beet red I dont have this issue when I use after washing my face at night or

kind of alcohol solution It broke me out and barely any products break me out Ive been trying this bad boy out the past couple months and here are my thoughts it does a good job of what it claims to do It does help me to control my oil and I like how it feels on my skin alternatively it does feel a bit drying and I didnt see a big enough difference in my skin to repurchase My skin is oily but I guess not to the point where I find this is impactful I have dry skin and struggle with clogged pores I added this toner to my night routine and it cleans any remain product It works okay for cleaning but I havent noticed any pore refinements and I do not like the smell I am going to try another bottle and add to my morning routine This product lasted a few months considering the frequent use I got

priced product Ive ever used If you read the ingredients you can see that not only does it have alcohol doesnt matter that its naturally derived that is a super drying ingredient its all things that you can access easily and thus this toner is easily dupeable vía DIY Its just water alcohol and essential oils like rosemary and mint By the way the rosemary and mint can be really astringent and

learned do NOT buy into hype Unreal makeup remover Gets even waterproof makeup off in a few passes Only downside is that your skin feels very oily after using it Toner takes that off for me This makeup remover USED TO BE my favourite a holy grail for the last 4 years but Im finally letting it go It steadily raised its price one of the reasons as to why I liked it and I just cant justify staying loyal with the product anymore I used to buy it when it was 18 but I dont understand what nonsensical archemy mustve been involved for it to raise its price and not do anything more magical

Mary Kays better because it didnt sting my eyes I bought this because I ran out of the Clinique and I wish I hadnt It BURNS my eyes and doesnt even get off all my mascara And I dont even use waterproof mascara I have to scrub to get it to work too With Mary Kay I put it on a cotton pad hold for 10 seconds and in one swipe everything is off Not with this I have to SCRUB So annoying If I could give zero stars I would\\nread more Poor quality eye makeup remover Doesnt remove all of your mascara and kinda stings a little when using over and over but you have to use over and over because it doesnt take it off completely I usually use Neutrogena but wanted to try something different but I wont be buying this again I might actually try the Lancôme brand as well I had been using this product for at least ten years It was the best eye makeup remover since switching over from another great but discontinued one However I have noticed when shaking and dispersing over my eyes I have found it to be much more oily I dont find it so effective anymore it seems too oily I believe  like a lot of products  its been altered  with less of whatever is in the blue part of this remover It used to be more concentrated in that part and now I think thats why its more oily Still good just not for my skin\\nread more Great until they reformulated it Its very weak and requires tugging and

to SCRUB So annoying If I could give zero stars I would\\nread more Poor quality eye makeup remover Doesnt remove all of your mascara and kinda stings a little when using over and over but you have to use over and over because it doesnt take it off completely I usually use Neutrogena but wanted to try something different but I wont be buying this again I might actually try the Lancôme brand as well I had been using this product for at least ten years It was the best eye makeup remover since switching over from another great but discontinued one However I have noticed when shaking and dispersing over my eyes I have found it to be much more oily I dont find it so effective anymore it seems too oily I believe  like a lot of products  its been altered  with less of whatever is in the blue part of this remover It used to be more concentrated in that part and now I think thats why its more oily Still good just not for my skin\\nread more Great until they reformulated it Its very weak and requires tugging and using a ton of it Purchased for many years but now switching to Clarins great product gets makeupoff so easily and doesnt make my skin breakout I didnt like this for removing mascaras I applied a huge amount of product on a pad but still it felt as if I am rubbing dry pad around my eye I mostly use makeup removers that can be used in shower but in those lazy days when I get home late or too tired and I want to remove my makeup asap  I used Bifacil by Lancôme or makeup removing wipes As I was using those I noticed I have to rub my eyes excessively to remove my washable mascara which damaged my eyelashes I was looking for smth better that would remove efortlessly my makeup I did my research and saw Clinique makeup remover being so popular here having tons of amazing reviews including those that said its much better than bifacil I was also very pleased with the price so I decided to buy biggest size and was waiting for my product with excitement Now I want to explain very detailed what is the difference between bifacil bf and clinique cl when you look at both bottles they seem to have relatively same amount of liquid and oil but ones you use cotton pad with cl and start using it on your eyes you notice only oil no liquid you have to rub same amount of time like with bf but its super oily greasy gets into your eyes and irritates them mascara does not just melt on the pad like with bf but flakes and those flakes dragg everywhere on your face so you need either a makeup removing wipe or another cotton pad with a more liquid product to remove all that mess Bf feels more liquidy not too oily does not get into your eyes and melts mascara in a way that it transfers to the pad in a clean way I only need to use one pad with bf eyes and 1 bf for face with cl I need much more pads and more work and the whole process is messy and oily Now I am left with jumbo size of this product that I have to use somehow as I dont like to waste or return stuff but I learned my lesson I will never buy a makeup remover without trying a sampler What I found to be removing mascara easier and gentlier is Tatcha camelia cleansing oil and if any of you guys will find a double phase makeup remover that really works please dm me\\nread more I usually love everything Clinique but I am not fully satisfied with this product My first issue is that it feels a bit oily on my skin My other issue is the bottle type I like the one where you put the cotton round on the top and pump down to get it wet Ive tried about a dozen eye makeup removers and I found this one to be merely adequate It didnt do an extraordinary job of removing mascara and eyeliner Plus I didnt care for the taste of it when I used it to remove lip crayon  and the taste lingered even after I brushed my teeth I am a believer in dualphase eye makeup removers but I can think of at least two that outperform this one great product gets makeupoff so easily and doesnt make my skin breakout I

continue purchasing Really like this cleanser My skin is on the sensitive side but it does not irritate it at all and most importantly it doesnt leave my skin feeling tight after washing The only

three months and didnot see any difference I like this cleanser overall because it does a good job of cleaning off dirt and oil I do double cleanse since it wont remove eye makeup completely on its own Unfortunately its too drying for long Canadian winters in the prairies I really like this cleanser It has a toothpaste like texture when you squeeze is out if the bottle and when you add water it lathers up ok The smell is nice not overwhelming It leaves my skin felling fresh and clean I do feel like you need lots of water to lather it up or it feels cakey on the skin Do not like this face wash It is so stripping to the skin giving it a squeaky clean feeling If youre serious about skin care I would not recommend It is super drying as soon as you step out of the shower or as soon as you dry your face off with a towel I dont usually write reviews but it bothers me how the makers lie to you in the face This thing although it says never tightpulled or parched does exactly that Stay away I had to throw it out 24 to the garbage Huge dissapointment Never again will buy any Origins products Ever For lying Cannot trust them anymore This does exactly what its called Its very frothy Still a little thick for me but works well Received it as a sample Ordered full size product Loved the feel of product Im always on the fence if I actually love this stuff My skin is dry sensitive and acne prone Ive been getting jawline and neck acne for the first time in my life  yay messed up hormones and this cleanser keeps it at bay for sure HOWEVER if I use this all over my face its a red itchy blotchy mess Sensitive skinned people probably should avoid this one Dont recommend this Dont recommend this Pimples pimples Stay away I like this cleanser overall because it does a good job of

this Pimples pimples Stay away Bought this because I really wanted to try something with calendula for the calming effects This toner does calm the skin but didnt completely take away the redness especially if you have acne issues The texture is lightweight so it absorbs quickly and serumsoils can be applied easily Would give it 4 stars but the price makes me bump it down to 3 There are other toners that work just as well for much cheaper\\nread more This toner is just really amazing for my normal skin It hydrated and soothes without being heavy or greasy It does not tingle but somehow balances my skin better than the toners that do Its the best Ive tried so far Four out of five only because I ordered it online and the cap was broken I tape it securely after each use Next time I will buy in storeWill definitely be repurchasing This is a gem Unfortunately this toner didnt do anything for my skin other than break me out with cystic acne  Didnt love this product Packaging is poorly designed The flowers easily come out of the bottle which leaves you trying to apply a chunky watery mess to your face Despite the design flaws I would have kept using it had I saw an improvement in my skin Unfortunately this did not work for me so I had to return I love this stuff Its really become my favorite toner and has helped calm my skin down from redness The herbal smell is really nice Like a brewed tea The only thing I dont like is how the petals come out of the stopper when you get down towards the end of the bottle They are slimy lol And it can be annoying to have to pick them off your face I would recommend for oily acne prone sensitive skin ive heard a lot of words telling me how good it is for acnes which made me have rlly high expectations for this but honestly for me who has combination skin and T zone is oily but cheeks are normal to dry is a little bit of useless cuz my face is not hydrated enough but my forehead and nose was just okay i didnt c my acne actually getting better but maybe thats bc of individual speciality of skin conditions anyway a good product for oil control cuz it balance the oil and water in ur face but not so good for ppl hav dry skin areas\\nread more I loved the smell liked how it felt on my face and then I noticed that I kept leaving residue of calendula petals on my face Not for someone whose entire skincare

one a try since it has this high rating It dries out my skin so bad It might be ok for the summer but not defending for winter The good thing about causalie is that its good for both summer and winter If you have sensitive skin youll love this cleanser This is a very basicgentle cleanser and it doesnt really do much The foam almost goes away as your washing and I expected a more clean feeling Wont be repurchasing Didnt do much for me Not crazy about the smell Will continue to use but wont be repurchasing This product Makes me break out  disappointing I really liked the product at first  great smell and was really gentle I have sensitive skin and I thought this product would be great for some of the redness The product however it seems is too drying and has made the redness worse over the last few weeks I love Olehenriksen and Im sad this product did not do well I like the product  actually is the second time what I got but didnt like the new presentation because stopped to work after a few days to use and when I press get locked in there and nothing comes out This made my skin break out from the minute I used it At first I thought it was getting everything out from my skin but its been a month now and my skin is always breaking out I really wanted this cleanser to work for me I have oilycombination skin and loved how foamy it was The citrusy scent was also really refreshing but for some reason it dried me out too much I was hoping it wasnt this cleanser that caused that so I stopped using it for 4 days The minute I used it again I woke up with dry patches this product dried my face out and caused acene somehow This cleanser smells so great Its foaming and it really makes you feel clean and refreshed Very hydrating The packaging is really cute too This cleanser was fine for the more oily parts of my skin cheekschin but wreaked havoc on my t zone it made my forehead so dry and actually broke me out i thought maybe it was just one time but even when i gave it a rest for a while and then used it again the same thing and it took my skin a week or two to recover I usually love OLE products as I use several others but this one didnt work for me I tried it for a while and realized after a few weeks that it was breaking me out and irritating my skin After I discontinued use my skin cleared back up within the next week It is definitely gentle and smells like oranges which I love Citrus scents are my favorite but I did notice it didnt get all my make up off but I would say it got 80 and I was looking more for something that would take off 90 at least This was also after I used a make up remover wipe so Im a little disappointed but I still like it Wouldnt repurchase but I am enjoying it until its gone I have a very oily skin but it gets a bit dryer during winter

until its gone This has a strong artificial almond sugar scent Its Yankee Candle intense Washed it off immediately also granules are massive Awesome smell awesome feeling afterwards Harsh for sensitive skin Broke out my face I like this scrub particles and big and feel nice on the skin Wish it exfoliated on a finer level but I guess maybe you need finer particles for that Not sure Id repurchase this is a fantastic product even my husband loves it Ive noticed a big transformation in his skin his wrinkles have even softened up and his skin just looks really healthy This scrub smelled so good Its a rough scrub but its very nice for a once a week treatment I really enjoyed how my skin looked using this product Love this product and will definitely use it again Great as a gentle scrub for very sensitive skin only use it 1 or 2 times a week I do find the scent really overwhelming Since I do have very sensitive skin I wash my face with a wash RIGHT after using it since I get a little worried about breakouts from the fragrance This is a good quality scrub and I absolutely will be buying again Removes the dead skin off my face and makes it soft and smooth I use it twice a week It will make ur face very soft but that is about it Yes its definitely better than the apricot scrub but everything comes with a price It did not fix my texture and did not brighten the dark spots let us begin with the good this stuff will take off dead skin like its nothing and smells like blueberries the bad if you scrub too hard you can hurt your skin just be careful I love Ole products but this was just sub par Nothing special I could find an equivalent at a drug store for much cheaper Was a little harsh and left my skin feeling squeaky This has a strong artificial almond

through my face I want to love this so much Its almost perfect until it broke me out It honestly made me sad cause this seems to be a great cleanser I was looking for a hydrating cleanser to use in the mornings and this one is perfect Its so gentle and foams really nicely once you add water to it It has a slight scent which I cant put my finger on but Its really calming Not overpowering at all I highly recommend This cleanser was very smooth upon application and foamed really nicely I had high hopes and although the smell was a little nauseating being made of yogurt and all it was tolerable Unfortunately my skin started peeling after my first use Ive used it 4 times and my skin on my nose and forehead is peeling like a bad sunburn Even retinol doesnt do this to me skin Did not work for me Broke me out The only thing that changed in my nightly routine Personally this did not work for me Made my skin feel super stripped and squeaky Had to moisturize big time after using The fragrance

is working I have really dry skin so adding this to my skincare routine has made such a huge difference Its super hydrating and acts as an essence as well One star off because it has a really strong scent not my favorite I received this product in this years Sephora Favorites Skincares Next Big Thing kit This was my first time using a toner and I liked the smell and felt like it helped mildly soften my skin I did not like that it was a spray and the nozzle spread the toner in a long horizontal line I wanted to use it directly on my face so I didnt waste product It wouldve been easier to use a cotton pad if this were an open bottle and not a spray\\nread more Ive used Caudalies Beauty Elixir for YEARS and love it But hey Im getting older and in an effort to up my antiaging skin care I bought this bc clean products are also important to me despite doubts about efficacy of topical application of CoQ10 vs ingestion I was very hoperful but despite giving a long adjustment period my very sensitive skin acne prone dry etc was not happy and kept breaking out I ended up giving the rest of the bottle to my sister who loves it So if your skin is more tolerant of various productsingredients give it a go Otherwise I recommend steering clear\\nread more I would have given this product at least 4 if not 5 stars but the spray nozzle is HORRIBLE It makes it impossible to use as recommended unless you like uneven harsh sprays to the face which leaves you with the only option of spraying it to a cotton pad in order to use it Got this bc I read that CoQ10 is great for aging skin Have nearly used up the large bottle and honestly cant tell a difference Do I need this Probably not Buuuut I cant say that its not prevented me from looking worse even on a micro level So Ill probably continue using until something else catches my attention I got this in the Skins Next Big Thing box recommend and I was SO excited to try it out I carry it in my purse and spray it directly on my face usually in the middle of the day when I can feel my skin getting tired and stressed out It definitely soothes my stressed out skin and leaves it feeling moisturized and looking slightly dewy My only problem is that the smell is somewhat offputting It just smells like baby lotion It goes away after a while though so its not a big deal In my opinion this is a little pricey for a toner but it is also marketed as like a toner essence deal If you have oily skin like me this may be worth the price as I think it definitely does help balance my skin\\nread more Unfortunately I am

is great for aging skin Have nearly used up the large bottle and honestly cant tell a difference Do I need this Probably not Buuuut I cant say that its not prevented me from looking worse even on a micro level So Ill probably continue using until something else catches my attention I got this in the Skins Next Big Thing box recommend and I was SO excited to try it out I carry it in my purse and spray it directly on my face usually in the middle of the day when I can feel my skin getting tired and stressed out It definitely soothes my stressed out skin and leaves it feeling moisturized and looking slightly dewy My only problem is that the smell is somewhat offputting It just smells like baby lotion It goes away after a while though so its not a big deal In my opinion this is a little pricey for a toner but it is also marketed as like a toner essence deal If you have oily skin like me this may be worth the price as I think it definitely does help balance my skin\\nread more Unfortunately I am not a fan of this toner I didnt see any benefit after using it I feel like it may even have caused some a slight breakout after each use Love the smell and the gel texture Feels like a deep cleanse without being too dry 4 star because it is a little on the pricey side This really didnt do much for my skin I actually found that I broke out more often Not bad but not really great Some background  I have very sensitive skin rosacea and acne It is one of VERY few cleansers that does not make my rosacea flare up Its not harsh on the skin It also smells amazing One thing I will say is that I dont see a huge difference with my discoloration due to old acne It definitely helps a little but wont completely get rid of it  you should use this along with other products I would definitely recommend especially if you have sensitive skin this was a saving grace for me\\nread more This was super irritating to my regulartosensitive skin Its pretty harsh and the smell is not great I had to abandon it and for that price I was disappointed It cleanses It smells okay Thats about all I can say about the generous sample that I received I couldnt find anything outstanding about it Does a good job at cleaning but overall not outstanding for the price please do not buy this does not clean It does not even work as a double cleanse second step This smells so bad like old sweet candy I got it in a play box and I regret using it because it broke me out True a blueberry cleanser from another brand its way better Had to wash face three times to feel clean 4 pads of micellar water later skin is clean It smells nice Doesnt take makeup off at all Love the smell and the gel texture Feels like a deep cleanse without being too dry 4 star because it is a little on the

True a blueberry cleanser from another brand its way better Had to wash face three times to feel clean 4 pads of micellar water later skin is clean It smells nice Doesnt take makeup off at all Its okay I dont love it There are better creams out there I bought the sample size thankfully Wont be repurchasing I cant live without this product Winter in Maine is rough especially on my skin This stuff keeps me moisturized like nothing else No flaky skin I wear this under makeup and my foundation doesnt crack and keeps my look looking fresh I highly recommend Personally I would consider this product more of a gel than a cream but unlike other gel moisturizers its not overly sticky and absorbs quickly which I love Its a bit overpriced in my opinion so I probably wont switch but it is a decent nongreasy moisturizer that lives up to its name Im used to moisturizers feeling silky smooth once applied I felt like I needed to wash my face again and didnt like the texture on my face Unfortunately this moisturizer wasnt the right one for my skin This is a good moisturiser but Im not sure that I would buy it again because of the essentials oils contained This can be irritable for sensitive skin and I prefer to avoid them I love this moisturizer it keeps my skin nice and soft Whats pretty great is that its been helping a bit with my oily skin I still get oily but I feel like its improved a lot since ive been using this I like it but prefer Clinique moisture surge  Nice fresh scent and feels soothing I just need more hydration I was introduced to this product by a Sephora associate during a makeover I love its lightness and how it moisturizes But I had the packaging The vessel for the product is the same diameter as the lid Whether fullsize or in a sample size 14 of the jar is simply plastic and not product I feel misled each time I open it The price Nope I received a sample via an ad off Instagram sweet But its not any better than a thick moisturizing cream Yes it is thinner than drug store heavy cream for makeup removal hello drama club in high school but definitely a waste of money Sorry dont understand the hype got it in the skin wonderland box I decided to try it but honestly any drug store moisturizer would do the same as this actually smells like nivea I would recommend any other brand over this People save your money buy something else Save yourself 179 and just buy some petroleum jelly Seriously Its one of the main ingredients here I received this as a sample and was very excited to try it Ive heard good things about La Mer and its a pricey product so sampling was really the only way Id ever try it out Im only here now writing a review because I was looking up the product to make sure it is indeed intended for face I was halfway convinced Id put something meant for my hands or body on my face This stuff parched my skin It felt nice during initial application but it sucked me dry throughout the day I used it two days in a row and was the worse for it It sure does work fast Im now going through the process of rebalancing my skin to where it was before this cream upset it Very glad I only committed to a sample I will not be finishing it\\nread more I love the consistency of this face cream Its thick and creamy and made my skin feel so silky smooth and moisturized However the smell is so strong that I could barely sleep It has a thick floral scent which smells good but is really distracting to lather all over your face Also the price is definitely not worth it Awesome formula but very similar to Curologys The Rich Moisturizer which is actually better in my opinion because it is unscented and costs a fraction of the price That being said if you can afford it and the smell is your jam this truly is an awesome cream\\nread more Ive wanted to try this moisturizer for a long time and I finally had my chance It is a great product a little goes a long way my skin is super soft and bright but its not worth the price The smell is not great reminds me of a 80 year old woman You can get similar results with Drunk Elephant at a much better price This is my goto moisturizer when my skin is in serious need of some TLC I usually use this after one of my scrubs or exfoliators Its extremely hydrating and nourishing I love this cream At first I was skeptical because my skin breaks out so easily and at an alarming rate at that but for some reason the soft cream really meshes well with my acne prone combination skin The only downside of course is the price but I only have one face so spending a pretty penny on products seems justifiable I have combination skin very dehydrated flaked nose I put this on twice a day its really nice but the only problem is it takes longer to absorb so you might not wanna use it in the morning before makeup I LIKE THE TREATMENT LOTION go for this instead I got this as a gift and I have to say it does work very well My skin feels super moisturized I have combination skin and it didnt make me break out which is nice But I dont think its worth the expensive price tag I feel like I get the same results from the Sephora brand moisturizer Other than that its a great product though I am 35 and have combo skin that is more parched in my cheeks than oily in my Tzone Overall I like this product but dont love it While it is moisturizing initially the hydration doesnt last through the day I had to add oil rose hips marula or the Ordinarys B Oil into this moisturizer to give it a little more ooph unfortunately I look like an oil slick for a few minutes after doing so Also I dont see it adding much into my skin Not as moisturizing as DE Protini or FAB and doesnt improve my skin like La Mer dont laughI am a skincare junkieLa Mers soft cream honestly improved my problem area\\nread more I had very high hopes for this because I love the eye bomb but this one was disappointing Its definitely not the most hydrating moisturizer Ive ever used I was experiencing some dry patches near and around my noise and this did absolutely nothing When I use this I find that within hours I have dry skin flakes around my noise It doesnt leave my skin feeling smooth soft  supple The only thing I like is that it does make your skin look slightly glowy But other than that its not impressive\\nread more Not necessarily a bad product It gets the desired results but it is very greasy and smells like a pine based floor cleaner When my skin is thirsty this is what I use daily as my moisturizer I really like this foundation This is the perfect shade for me and really helps mute my cool undertones I LOVE that it has SPF and like the dewy look it gives me I know others have described it as greasy but I really think it looks more dewy than anything  maybe others tend more towards matte finishes Im only giving it 4 stars because Ive found that it can be very tricky to get to apply well and last for the day I do have acne prone skin with texture so it could just be my skin However Ive found even with moisturized skin and primer the foundation doesnt always last throughout the day\\nread more Im still on the fence about this product even after 2 weeks of using it I love that the shade is a perfect match for my asian skin tone but the product feels heavy and makes my face look so greasy I hoped it would be moisturizing for my combination skin but I dont really see a difference I do like that it has a good rating on EWG and it is made with clean ingredients and included sunscreen but I just wish the consistency of the product was a bit more watery instead of like a mousse\\nread more I really liked how this product went on and the coverage it provided But it was too greasy and heavy It caused acnebreakouts I have sensitive acneprone combinationdry skin too heavy and greasy not light like a moisturizer Felt heavy like foundation It dried out my skin and made my tiny pores appear huge I could see it crumbling and moving around on my face throughout the day Its a shame because so many people love this stuff but my bare skin looks better Im going back to my Fresh renewed hope in a jar skin tint I made the switch from foundation to bb creams and couldnt be happier about it This one lets my natural pinkness show through while smoothing out my overall tone to look even and natural Only reason for 4 not 5 stars is that Im very pale and this was just a little too dark on me I got this as a promo in my order and was so excited to try it I was so disappointed after applying it and just figured it couldnt be true maybe it was me I went back online to look at some of the reviews and it seems that people whod used it before were also disappointed in the apparent reformulation My skin had been so nice recently but the moment I applied this to my face ALL of the dry patches appeared Looking at my face I just couldnt find one silver lining in it Id never been so hasty about it before but I really had to rewash my face and apply something else immediately Justyipes\\nread more The updated version of this burns my skin and breaks me out too This was my dream cream it was the best skincare product for my face ever not anymore Extreme disappointment Youth Preserve Face Cream with Super 7 Complex was my go to moisturizer for years and I loved it It was gentle enough for my sensitive skin and never caused any breakouts Unfortunately the new moisturizer caused deep breakouts I wish they didnt change it I really enjoy the fresh floral smell and the consistency of this moisturizer It moisturizes well and I didnt experience any break outs I feel like after applying my skin looks a little more greasy than fresh and dewy but overall I enjoyed this moisturizer I think it works better for slightly more mature skin Not good for dry skin at all Left my face feeling tight and I looked patchy Will return and get the tatcha I gave it a 4 start because I dont have any puffiness under my eyes so I cant say it works for that but I really do enjoy this eye cream its very soft and creamy It absorbs very nicely into my skin I can feel a difference when I use it I have very dry undereyes so I like something that keeps them moisturized I dont wear a lot of make up but I found it does work well when applied under some concealer I got this product complimentary from influenster and having oily acne prone skin I was a little afraid but decided to give it a try My skin feels fresh and hydrated right away because it is not greasy feel at all  I just decided to use ir one day in between to avoid break outs So far so good This line works really well for my skin This moisturizer is not super thick and applies smoothly and sinks into the skin quickly The light lotus scent is enjoyable and my skin looks hydrated immediately When wearing without makeup my skin feels super soft even hours later This was a good product that goes well with the set of dream cream and eye cream It has a good smell However not so moisturizing I loved the Lotus Youth Preserve Face Cream and I accidentally picked this one similar packaging and I thought how different can it be I had a lot of breakouts and the dry areas on my skin got worse It took more than a week to show these results that I cant even return it now Very disappointed I just hope the face cream is not discontinued as Im unable to find it on the site Ive been using this cream for several weeks and it feels good on my skin I have normal to oily skin with dehydration so I love feeling like Im pampering my skin with really rich creams but I cant really use those much because they tend to leave me feeling sticky and oily Well the texture of this one is buttery thick and smooth When I first apply it it feels rich and comforting but it doesnt sit on my skin for long before sinking right in It feels like a rich cream as you apply but then sinks in like a gel within 2 minutes So if you dodont like the feel of a rich cream or if you dodont want your cream to absorb like a gel or if you need moreless hydration this cream is kind of a mix of all that Once it absorbs my skin feels comfortable and soft not greasy and fully dry but not tight Its kind of the perfect feel for me The scent is like fresh cucumbers with lemon Not my favorite scent but its not unpleasant And it doesnt sting my eyes The only reason I removed a star is because several times after a few hours I start getting an awful smell from it Its the smell of oils that went stale Whenever Ive had a face oil go bad Ive thrown it away because its a hard smell to tolerate I havent thrown out this cream but I might have to if the smell keeps appearing Maybe I got a bad batch\\nread more This was a good product that goes well with the set of dream cream and eye cream But I find it similar to other moisturizer I use Nothing bad about this but nothing special that stood out Would recommend as a everyday moisturizer I love the texture and the glide of this moisturizer but the scent I cannot get over it  The eye cream and dream cream from this line smell amazing but for some reason this particular product the cucumber smell bothers me It it were not scented I would love 100xs more but if you like a cucumber scent youll love this cream much more  Other than the smell the product performs amazingly I received as a gift for testing purposes\\nread more Its okay doesnt really moisturize my face to the point where I want it soft but does the basic job I enjoy this cream in that it goes on smoothly is not greasy and seems to sink right into my dry skin It has a faint pleasant scent It does not irritate my skin at all Its not as thick going on as it looksfeels and spreads nicely and actually leaves my skin feeling about the same until it has some time to work In about 10 minutes my skin feels moisturized The reason for 4 stars is that I would in no way consider this to be intensely hydrating Its calming and moisturizing enough but nothing intense about it I also hate that it is in a tub  thats just annoying packaging\\nread more Initially I loved this moisturizer I have very dry skin especially in the winter and I thought I had finally found my skin savior However after about a month of use my pores were incredibly clogged and I broke out worse than ever before  Really wish this would have worked for me Its a nice moisturizer but it doesnt help with dry skin at all Seriously if you have any dry skin THIS WILL NOT HELP YOU But if youre looking to slightly hydrate your skin this will do Im kind of sad because the ratings on this was so high Also I never leave reviews but I felt like I needed to or something not sure exactly how I feelit works well overnight in combination with my acne meds but during the day it makes my skin very oily I think if you have combo to oily skin this is good to use once a day but definitely not twice a day I started to get whiteheads on my face so there was something in there that was clogging my pores I do see now it says for face and elsewhere so I dont think this is good for sensitive skin I wouldnt put a body lotion on my face I was hoping this would cure my dry skin and acne combo It did not help with dryness at all If anything I had to layer more creams overtop just to not feel any tightness in my cheeks nose and forehead It also seems to clog my pores I stopped using it on my face and now use it on my body so that I can finish the tub I bought I wanted to like this product so much I have combination skin I have have sections that are so dry and flaky and others that are pretty normal Well this stuff did cure the dryness but it also made my skin so oily that I was having all kinds of breakouts Love this product for night application on my extremely dry skin days Minus 1 star for packaging appeareanceit looks medicinal i was given a sample of this and was excited to see how it would react with my oily acne prone skin it broke me out badly with whiteheads where i normally dont break out so i decided to only use it on my undereyes and neck i got small bumps on my neck and under my eyes its a nightmare lotion that didnt agree with my skin at all It is a lightweight gel and it soaks up fast A little too fast in fact For my dry spots it doesnt provide enough hydration Certainly not 72 hours worth Might be sufficient in the summer though I tried this product twice and both times it broke me out on the first day smh I dont understand what is in this product I stopped getting acne at around 20 yrs old so its really strange that I tried this product and it didnt react well When I first put this on my face it felt like velvet It feels good putting it on your skin but I quickly became aware that it never fully soaks into my skin It is absolutely terrible under foundation I have tried multiple times now some where Ive tried waiting 15 min after putting on the moisturizer to then put on foundation It always pills into little balls and does not sit smoothly on my face Ive tried with the too faced born this way foundation makeup forever ultra HD foundation and the Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation It happens with all of them and is very disappointing I will continue to use this moisturizer on days where I wont be wearing foundation but I will not repurchase this product\\nread more Got the small size in a set and I really liked it at first It didnt sting unlike some other moisturizers and was really hydrating After a while I realized it was causing my forehead to breakout but I can use it on the rest of my face Great light moisturizing gel I have sensitive skin so it can sting a little I think it is because of the urea in it but if my skin is hydrated it wont sting and the sting goes away right away It is GREAT on top of make up I have dry skin so sometimes I apply it over my make up where I feel dry and it does not ruin my foundation  just dont rub it in too much  Overall a great gel I think it is better suited for oily skin mine is dry I have purchased it three times I dont use it every day but keep coming back to it when I feel that I need it\\nread more Made me break out a lot and would leave my skin looking full and no shine The name makes this sound like a powerhouse but it is extremely light and had pretty much no effect on my dry skin Probably an ok product for someone in their 20s who wants a very lighttouch moisturizer because it absorbs quickly and disappears I ordered this moisturizer because of the great reviews and I like the idea of combining steps in my morning routine I made the impulse buy online without ever sampling the product it was on a flash sale My first reaction was the awful fragrance It is STRONG for a product you put on your face I seriously sneezed the first few times I put it on it reminds me of something my grandmother would wear Then after I had already purchased it I did a quick search to see if Bobbi Brown products are crueltyfree I assumed they were because well I like Bobbi and she seems lovely Lol But she is NOT CRUELTYFREE There is no reason to not be crueltyfree in 2020 There are so many great brands that are good to the planet I returned this and got Youth to the People Adaptogen Cream and Smashbox Photo Finish Primer Amazing creams for my dry skin mild reasonable fragrances and company practices I want to support We vote with our  and Im voting elsewhere now Sorry Bobbi\\nread more It does what it claim to do but the price is beyond RIDICULOUS great for sensitive skin tho Way too much money for what it is Id say its an average primer Not really a moisturizer Vitamin Enriched Face Base Priming Moisturizer I do not get the Hype at all It is a pretty decent moisturizer but I found that the primer aspect said FIND ME in this product Also it smells like a household cleaner or bug spray After my moisture routine before makeup Ill put this as my last step It smells nice citrusy which is a plus As for wear Id say it work very well in moist warmer areaslocations I think its an amazing product to just have for moisturizer plus primer Wait till its less tacky to apply foundation and stuff Ive tried this a few times now and have now concluded I dont like it It leaves my skin tacky and never dries down or feels smooth I guess because its moisturizing Personally I like the way it smells light and lemony but I really prefer no fragrance for products that I apply to my skin It causes pilling whenever I touch my face afterwards  like just rubbing my nose It doesnt dull the shine of my sunscreen either Glad it was only a sample\\nread more This product is very lightweight Makes your face feel fresh and invincible I just dont think the price is worth the product Perhaps I havent used it enough to judge that so Ill continue with a follow up rating when I finish it I received this as a sample from Sephora and really wanted to like it but the smell is completely overpowering It is so strong that I thought I had somehow received a solid perfume of some sort We immediately had to wash my face and start over moisturizer does not keep hydration on the face for very long Would not reorder Have used much better in the past i was so undecided on a new moisturizer i use many fresh products and i love them i heard about this moisturizer and read some of the reviews i was reading the 1 star reviews and saw that people are breaking out from this product my friend used to get this and said she loves it so i gave it a try my skin has been pretty clear for a little while now after less than 3 days i started to notice tiny little pimples around my cheeks nose and chin i will be returning this product and i dont advise buying this\\nread more Its good as a moisturizer alone not to heavy perfect to use at home with no make up on When you put foundation on after the moisturizing step it peeled off resulting in peeling skin on the face This productto me wasnt great It does NOT layer well with other products unless completely dry and no one has time for that It balls up really badly even if you go over with another layer of the same cream Its so fussy to use Usually fresh is so good but this one let me down Doesnt seem particularly moisturizing either for how thick it is Wont be repurchasing I loved this product  isnt too heavy didnt break me out the scent is delicate and not super intense It really soaked into my skin nicely without looking greasy Unfortunately it broke up my setting powder without it sinking in fully Ive tried multiple setting powders  granted I had never had issues with either before using this moisturizer and was disappointed when it continued to become patchy and break up with different brands of setting powders I had high hopes for it and I dont know if it was just my personal skin and it didnt react well with my makeup or if this is a common problem but I was disappointed with how it affected my overall makeup look\\nread more I feel as if this moisturizer does a decent job moisturizing but every single time I use it I break out Unfortunately I bought it over the summer last year and didnt start using it again until recently so its too late for me to return it I would either purchase the smaller option of this moisturizer or get a sample if possible to test it on your skin The fragrance in this is a little too strong for my liking as well Purchased this moisturizer to pair with the Fresh Rose Hydration serum and the combo just didnt work for me The moisturizer on its own also did not provide enough hydration and my skin felt tight and dry even after applying Granted with most moisturizers at least for me I have to pair them with another product to help with dryness around my chincheeksThe smell is nice Made my redness even worse Very greasy very heavy just not good at all Got this as a sample and loved it I have VERY sensitive skin and surprisingly my skin did not react badly The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the fact that there is fragrance in it  I am scared that if I use it long term it might break me out or cause sensitivity I was really excited to try this after reading reviews but unfortunately this product did not work for me The scent is extremely strong and it caused me to break out I really wanted to love this cream Ive read the good reviews and the bad ones so I was hoping that it would be the best for me but sadly I understand why the bad reviews mentioned that the moisturizer gives weird clumps Yes this clumped on my face and its really hard to apply makeup with the clumps The scent and all is really nice though I thought of returning it but Im sticking with it for a night cream and it works really well Hopefully the clumping is only temporary and later it gets better\\nread more I really like this for no makeupmakeup days It evens out my skin tone just enough but not too much to look super makeupy It doesnt irritate my skin either This is a great starter product for someone not yet willing to commit to a foundation like myself or someone who wants something a little lighter It applies great and has builtin sunscreen which is always a plus It can be a bit shiny when first applied but in my experience it mellows out with time and gives my skin a lovely vibrancy I would give it five stars but I have really sensitive skin and I think its giving me a few tiny like really small breakouts That being said my skin is quite finicky and hopefully with the right cleansing routine I can minimize if not eliminate these issues All the same others with more sensitive skin should consider approaching this product with mild caution\\nread more This product lasted me a while and worked well with my skin so I would definitely say its worth the money And I really like that theres sunscreen in it It never made my skin feel dry but sometimes it did look a little cakey The product matched my skin tone perfectly but the coverage wasnt moist enough for my skin and it created dry PACTHES on my face an employee from the Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua Nh told me it would be enough to hydrate my skin For anyone who has mildsuper dry skin I wouldnt recommend this product to you This was not quite enough coverage for me and my oily skin didnt love it I love the luminosity and finish to this but its giving me the worst breakout Ive had in like 3 years The texture is nice and it controls oil in my Tzone but its wreaking havoc on my jawline I still love Tarte but this one is not for me This does not blend at all It leaves patches on my skin where the makeup will not adhere no matter what I do It also appears super greasy by the end of the day and I do NOT have oily skin This product wiped off immediately and does not hold Even if i used a primer and powder My expectation with a BB cream is that it works without having to use additional products I would put this product on my face and it was almost like the color changed a few hours later and revealed my pores Overall really unhappy with the product and would not buy again Such a great tinted moisturizer The texture is very smooth and the color i picked out is nice Coverage is buildable and its got a nice finish Perfect for dryer skin types this for me is super cakey it takes the life out of my skin and i look super dead i feel I really like this tinted moisturizer but I wish it came in more colors As soon as I have any sun this is crazy light for me but I usually just finesse it with some bronzer and the rest of my face makeup Its easy on and it looks like a light to medium foundation when I use it with the Tatcha Silk Canvas I use and love the Cicapair cream and love its very faint herby smell So I was very excited to try other Dr Jart products and had been planning to buy this as soon as my regular moisturizer ran out The feel is incredible and Im sure its a good product I just cant use it because of the heavy fragrance which gives me a headache Besides its very well known in the skincare community that fragrance is irritating to the skin\\nread more If you are very dry then this is a must have It is thick but it definitely helps with my flaky skin from Retina Let me introduce you to the type of skin Ive been battling this winter Its my first time dealing with extremely dry flaky patches of skin on my face  neck It definitely is eczema and I was prescribed with a ointment However I needed a daily moisturizer that would help me After trying multiple creams I thought I found my holy grail Why do I say that Because when I first put apply this cream you can definitely feel the difference of how moisturizing it feels on vs the other creams Ive tried Its a little on the heavy side but a little does not o a long way for me It kept my face moist for a bit I definitely didnt have that tight dry feeling on my face anymore But I noticed I did have to keep reapplying throughout the day because I can see the patches started to flake and feel dry Even through these past couple days of 30 degree weather I felt it didnt do a great job considering I would still flake Even when I apply this after my night routine and I wake up in the morning Im still flaky and dry Ive had this for about a week and Im half way through the tube mind you it is quite expensive so I definitely had to find another cream Good news I have and Im going to write a review for it because I actually found something that worked I would say that this will work for someone with dry skin but not extremely dry flaky skin\\nread more I was so excited to use this but this ended up not being good for my skin I do not have oily skin Its a little on the dry side It gave me blackheads even on my cheeks I have never had another product do that before so Im a bit confused at why this happened Ill finish up the tube but only on my neck I will recommend it While it is very moisturizing after a week of using it my pores are super congested and I have more blackheads than ever Perhaps its better with a small amount just on patches and not the whole face but my skin is so dry I needed the moisture everywhere This moisturizer is fine It didnt heal my dry patches In addition the added fragrance is irritating Received a sample of this product and its been great for my sensitive skin The only thing is I dont like the smell it seems very mediciney to me Hopefully Ill get used to it Its pretty nourishing and smells good But it takes a while to sink in so not great for my morning routine where Im pressed for time between washing my face and putting on makeup This didnt do anything noticeably good for my skin Only thing it did was sting when I put it on Other than that it was an expensive cream I gave it to my mom who seems to enjoy it Just take note if you have sensitive skin Im not sold My face doesnt really feel dry but still always looks dry And its slightly greasy I definitely cant apply my makeup right after so I usually have a different day moisturizer Ever since I read that dry skin is aging skin  I started to look at my dry face less proudly for the fact that it does not break out I have been using this religiously  four pumps each morning and night and my skin has softened and become less dry I rarely break out and this goes beautifully under my daily Maybelline powder I dont go a week without receiving skin compliments It is a great BASIC Absolutely cannot stand this moisturizer I have dry skin and this just doesnt soak into my skin Its extremely frustrating I would try the yttp kale and spinach green tea hyaluronic acid moisture cream OR the Neutrogena GEL CREAM extra dry skin formula NOT the water gel This moisturizer sits on top of my skin and doesnt fully hydrate I still have dry patches and flaky skin Its very greasy and feels heavy Ive been using this consistently with my other trusted skincare items and its broken me out This has also clogged my pores and I have more whiteheads than ever before I received a sample of this and found it to be well hydrating  but maybe not in the winter Overall its lightweight not greasy but not one to slather on when your skin feels tight its so dry I bought this as a sample a few months ago to try for myself and ended up hating it It made me breakout and felt heavy on my skin My husband on the other hand has really dry skin with red flakey patches that would never really clear up I gave this to him to try and it hands down saved his skin I think 2 or 3 days of using this and the patches flaking cleared up He uses it every day and the patches havent returned\\nread more Omg I cannot even describe how horrible this stuff is I used it the first day I got the worst rash looking breakouts I put it on in the morning and slowly I started getting huge white bumps allllll over and I washed it when I got home but damage was already done My face has never broken out like this in my life Im glad I used the sample cuz I wouldnt recommend this product to anyone Still too dewy for me I have oily skin At first it was working well but as the days went on I felt it was going back to oily Very sticky product I didnt see any clear noticeable differences using this moisturizer My skin did not feel that moisturized I had high hopes because it has been such a highly rated moisturizer I love this product although it does turn my face a bit red I have sensitive skin and am use to getting random reactions I still find this products works great so I use it sparingly I have a trial size of this and although it is very moisturizing its not my fav and not worth the price point in my opinion It claims that it doesnt leave your face greasy but it does and it doesnt sit well under makeup If you use this use it before bed I also have to agree on the smell it doesnt smell great I like this cream as it goes on smooth and is very moisturizinghowever the smell is HORRENDOUS The cream smells like a sweaty jockstrap that has been left in a gym bag for a week I wish I were exaggerating The good thing is that the smell dissipates very quickly So if you can hold your breath while you first rub it in then youre good to go But really Biossance would do well to try and fix that issue I would say I would give this 35 stars\\nread more I rarely write reviews for a product but this time I had to come up here because I HATE this thing This is so overpriced and such a WASTE of my money First of all it gave me breakouts over my chin and my jaw I didnt want to think it was this so I tried to use it again after my break out went away Nope my face broke out again I dont know too much about ingredients but I bought this because I saw all kinds of skincare channels raving about the ingredients in this In addition I feel like the texture is really weird it is almost waxy and it does want to blend out on my skin evenly or skin in It leaves a film on my skin with a white cast not that I mind the white cast bc I use this product at night but I mean I have dryer skin and I live in upstate NYwinter here is terribleso I like heavy things This thing is heavy but it is floating on the top of the skin not really moisturizing Plus it smells like straight plastic Anyways PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product it is stupidly expensive Go get something else like the Curel cream or the belief moisturizing cream not the gel version or anything else Please guys I think even cetaphile at the drugstore works better\\nread more I would say that this moisturizer was actually very drying for me I have oilycombination skin Not super impressed by this moisturizer It wasnt too rich which was nice but I didnt feel very moisturized after using The price is pretty steep for uneventful outcome Wont be buying again Ive had this product about a week and Im really enjoying it I was looking for something really hydrating for this time of year but not too heavy as my last moisturizer was a little heavy still a fave though So far I like it a lot its smooth and lightweight I think it looks really good under my makeup as well The amount of product for the cost is not worth it While I love the way this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling and I feel it is SUPER hydrating it is worth mentioning that it leaves my skin quite oily before it fully absorbs The oily feeling I experience doesnt last more then an hour usually however I would definitely have liked to know that prior to trying it Other then that this is an amazing moisturizer with quality ingredients I received this as a sample with my beauty points I couldnt even use the sample because it had a rancid smell to it I love Biossances rose oil Not sure if I got a bad sample or if there is something wrong with this cream I got this as a sample in my recent order and didnt really have any expectations I have dry and sensitive skin and figured I would test this out It has a really lovely and thick texture and it is quite hydrating It does take a bit to truly sink into the skin so this works better if you use it at night It doesnt really have a smell its fragrant free which is nice I live in a dry climate so having a reliable moisturizer is crucial especially in the winter months I made the decision to switch the natural skincare products and Ive had great success with a cleanser serums and eye cream but Im really struggling with a moisturizer After reading reviews and doing some research I thought this one sounded like a good fit but I was a little disappointed in this cream because I found that it sat on top of my skin for most of the day instead of sinking in It didnt cause any problems like break outs or irritation but it just made my skin feel sort of sticky and heavy which I didnt like I prefer when my moisturizer absorbs and leaves my skin feeling supple and hydrating but not weighed down Unlike many of the other users I didnt mind the smell very much and I love the ingredients list so Im bummed that it didnt work out for me but it just wasnt a good fit Its still worth trying a sample size because it seems to work so well for other people but it just wasnt compatible with my skin and my preferences\\nread more I found this oil to be just ok I have oily skin and decided to try this as part of my night routine I love how light and nongreasy it feels on the skin and how well this absorbs With that in mind Im not a fan of lavender but I didnt find this too over powering even though its not my favourite scent I did not find it that it smoothed or boosted radiance in my skin I wouldnt go out of my way to purchase this but if I received it as a gift I would use every last drop because I think its a good oil to have if I needed it\\nread more I got a sample to try from Sephora This just burned and irritated my skin It also has a really strong smell kind of like fennel I couldnt stand it Try before you buy I had a small sample of this that lasted me about two weeks I was very happy with it overall It is a very light oil and doesnt feel like its sitting on top of your skin I used about 35 drops morning and night It didnt quite provide as much moisture as the Herbivore Lapis oil I currently use but I felt it was enough for warmer months The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming The main reason Im taking off one star is because I did feel like it slightly clogged my pores more than usual but if I had a full bottle Id still finish it\\nread more Broke me out I only used it twice and then I read the ingredients were mostly oils  go figure My friend gave this to me as a gift and omgsh I have oily and acne prone skin so I wasnt sure but used anyways and wow my rough skin is so smooth now I will say its important to wash your face in the morning after sleeping with this on when I dont I get at least one pimple If used correctly its AMAZING I did receive this as a free sample Ive used different serums that have made my skin look radiant This serum however doesnt improve anything nor does it feel like its retaining anything either My face looks extremely dull since I started using this I found this oil to be just ok I have oily skin and decided to try this as part of my night routine I love

recommended this product while searching for a tinted moisturizer because Philosophy has discontinued theirs After my first use I strongly considered returning because I hate the texture and feel of this product However I have noticed that it stays in place all day which is rare as I have oily skin I wont be returning it but I dont think Ill buy it again I dont like how flaky my skin looks when I use this and the texture is truly awful I dont understand how it can be oilfree when it feels so oily and siliconey Im very torn on this product because it does make my skin look nice Im just not a fan of how it applies I also dont find it buildable at all Kudos to Tarte for making a tinted primer with SPF that doesnt feel like SPF but this just isnt for me\\nread more IM NOT A TARTE FAN BUT THIS IS GREATITS SO HARD TO MAKE A FULL COVERAGE PRODUCT WITH SUN SCREEN IN IT BUT THEY HAVE I really like this products As I have gotten older my skin has gotten drier so using this daily after moisturizer has worked well The color stays put looks natural and cancels out some of my redness I work long hours and cant manage a fullface look every day but this stuff really helps me look healthy and put together Please dont stop making it This is my goto foundation for daytoday wear It feels super light like silk but definitely does not last all day It does a great job of evening out my skin tone and moderately hides blemishes I prefer it over the Supergoop BB cream This is an OK BB cream It helps cover redness but isnt thick It certainly doesnt cover acne It leaves my skin a bit oily and definitely does not last a full 12 hours To be fair I still havent found a satisfactory BB cream This one I had high hopes for but it is just OK This product had to grow on me but now its one of my absolute favorites And Im a big fan of multitasking beauty products and this is definitely one of them Its a BB Primer and Tinted Moisturizer all in one I use it mostly as a concealer and primer before I apply my full face This is as close to perfect as I can find for what I wanted I wanted a foundation that wasnt really full coverage and didnt look like I was obviously wearing makeup and would also not go shiny and settle into fine lines an hour after application But I wanted all of this in a silicone free formula This does everything I wanted blurs imperfections and evens skin tone without looking like makeup wears beautifully all day acts as a primer to lock in blushbronzerhighlighter and keeps skin perfectly matte However the silicone congests my skin and that is why I deducted a star I apply this with a damp beauty blender which works much better than smoothing onto skin with fingers spreads a thinner more even amount of product which does help create less congestion I would pay more to get the same thing without silicone\\nread more Looks good covers redness lightly but it settles into my expression lines on my forehead which I do not like I wear this instead of foundation and works perfectly for my skin and skin tone I have combination skin Love this product by target so quick and easy Mama of twins and always on the go  I really hoped this would work for me but it didnt Its kind of like a mousse version of Benefits POREfessional but dries to a matte finish more like Benefits old Big Easy I cant wear this on its own on my crazy combination verydry skin with oily tzone  it emphasized instead of camouflaging my mature skin Sigh Really nice coverage without being cakey you can definitely build it up in certain areas to a mediumfull coverage My only complaint as many others have mentioned is that the shade range is pretty bad and that the color comes out extremely gray It does seem to blend out and oxidize to a normal skin tone shade but a better shade range would make this product perfect I usually mix this with my foundation to wear to work for 810 hours and it works great this way\\nread more I fell this product is more of a CC than a BB It is heavily colored and I try to apply it lightly I do not wear foundation and opt for the very light Coola mineral BB This product does cover red well and provide even coverage Im 49 so perhaps thats something to do with it but found this leaving my skin looking oilygreasy  not good at all I love the way this makes my skin look It gives me that dewy no makeup look and its very light weight so you dont even notice youre wearing anything My only complaint is the shade range  I know its not a concealer or foundation but there is room for more than 3 shades   I do however recommend this product Worth a try for sure This is by far the best bb cream Ive tried The main PRO for me is it does not enhance my extremely dry skin It hides it so well with a beautiful dewyish finish The only CON imo is the color range It took me a while to notice because of how shell shocked I was at how good this made my skin look but in pictures on my fair neutral skin even the lightest shade looks way off  appears way way too pink toned but the product comes out gray very odd Worth a try especially if you like to mix base products but thats my take I still recommend because Of how good this product makes my skin feel\\nread more For Accutane users or dry skin folks worth a try I applied this to half my face to test it out and was surprised to like it It covered redness pretty well and I could easily see that helf my face looked more eventoned and smooth Even a little glowy It blended better than most tinted products that contain physical sunscreen and did not settle into my dry patches very much as the dr Jart cica cream did and most foundation products are doing right now that I have super dry skin I did hefty exfoliation beforehand again accutane Will likely purchase a fullsize product when my deluxe sample is gone The other bonus is that this blended well on my porcelain skin and was flattering  not orangey or obvious Impressed So surprised as Id rolled my eyes at it when I first opened my dr Jart samples box\\nread more I got this product in a kit It wasnt bad the coverage was nice however it left my skin feeling and looking really oily which for my combo skin I dont want I wasnt in love with it but I also didnt hate it The product itself is fantastic Just the right amount of pigment to even out my skin tone and also great skincare combined into one Im a big fan however the packaging is AWFUL When you get down to less than a quarter of product left the pump just stops working and there is still a lot of product left It should be in a squeeze tube but because I like the product so much I will continue to fight it out of the bottle\\nread more I recently purchased this BB cream as I am not a foundation person and thought that I can use this BB cream on daily basis and off course I read all the good reviews but this cream made my face look so patchy I thought let me give some days and see the result but no luck Every time I use this cream my face become so patchy and dull Light to medium is too light on me medium to deep is too dark I just cant seem to win with this BB cream I loved the coverage too I received this as a sample with one of my purchases If you are very light like I am this will be too dark for you Also more of a yellow undertone when Im more pink The coverage is actually pretty good if it was the right color But instead of a smoothing feeling after application it feels sticky I have tried a ton of BBs and this is by far my favorite formula It gives the perfect amount of coverage I use the light shade in the winter and mix light and deep together for summer months My only complaint and reason for four stars is the dispenser I have had many tubes of this and every single one stops coming out when youre not even half way through the tube I just unscrew the top and shake a small amount out and its fine\\nread more Ive loved this Dr Jart BB cream for many years but now that theyve changed the formula it irritates my skin It also has a fragrance to it that it never had before and its a bit dry  flaky Tried a couple different bottles just to make sure I didnt get a bad batch SOOO disappointed this used to be completely amazing and now its just trash Another great product bites the dust I knew as soon as I tried it out on my handFive 5 different silicones and 3 of them are in the first five ingredients After a few use it feels greasy and sits on my face It doesnt seem to moisturize my skin but makes it look less dry This is a very light and airy moisturizer I would say its probably better for summertime I just found it didnt really penetrate my skin very much It just kind of stayed on the surface Do not recommend gave me a chemical burnreaction around my nose and mouth and patches on my cheeks And gave me a terrible breakout I got this product as a sample with an order and let me freaking tell youit was amazing I have weird skin it changes but currently my skin is pretty dry Im talking dry skin flakes half attached to my face I cant wear certain foundations because my skin just looks awful and I have a lot of redness in my cheeks as well Ive had a hard time finding a face cream or moisturizer that really feels like it gets in there and moisturizes my face instead of just sitting on the surface and looking oily or causing breakouts something that lasts more than an hour When I used this product it had little to no smell and was almost watery upon applying I dont really condone spending 50 something dollars on something under 2 ozbut I would recommend this to anyone After using this I saw and felt an immediate difference in my skin and I fell in love with it and it lasted just under three daysafter using one freaking time If I had the opportunity and ability to buy this in bulk I would I only gave 4 stars because I havent used it for an extended period of time Do yourself a favor and try it out seriously\\nread more Great for acne prone skin with an oily t zone and sensitive skin I easily get break outs due to products being too heavy or harsh I put this on after using my Clarisonic and an under eye cream It is so light I got it in travel size in a multi pack and it came in a squeeze tube and Ive tried it in a jar as a single travel size item I have to say the squeeze tube is so much better My only complaint is that its in a jar making it unsanitary and exposed to air and elements every time its used I get more moneys worth in a squeeze tube for sure Please PTR put this product in a pump bottle or squeeze tube its so much more sanitary Its a light weight moisturizer and sinks into the skin well and keeps away dry patches from acne spot cream\\nread more Its such a lovely and nourishing texture that I really wanted to love it but it pills something awful If youre only using it at night it should be fine but if youre trying to use this in the morning and dont have an extra half hour while rushing to work to wait for it to settle before applying sunscreen its the worst It clumps in awful gray spots that look like lint I hope they find a way to fix that because I would love the feel of it otherwise\\nread more I got a sample of this product with my last order I loved the way it made my face feel but it straight up smelled like acetone Its a shame Anyone know if the full size smells like that I cannot stress enough how this ruined my face It caused such a bad breakout that it was painful to the touch For reference I take good care of my skin I had a travel size of this to pack during my drill weekends and I had to trash it today because it not only broke me out in random places like my chin and jawline but made my cheeks red and patchy I was not very impressed My skin type is very dry and this moisturizer is just way too lightweight for my skin type It soaked right in and almost made my face feel more dry afterwards Mildly hydrates and is very light Totally useless though I did not see any improvement on my face This essence is good however Ive been able to try several Japanese and Korean brand essences that perform and hydrate better for a fraction of the price Again it is a very nice formulation but with such easy access to Asian products this just ended up not being worth its price tag I returned this after 72 hours This essence make my face soft but in terms of brightening I havent noticed a difference and Im almost done with the bottle No scent and minimal ingredients so thats a plus for those with sensitive acne skin it didnt break me out too Oily combo skin here Purchased this tho king it would give me extra hydration and softness Im half way through the bottle and really havent noticed a difference in my skin I havent had any negative reactions to it either Probably will not repurchase I have no clue how this product has so many positive reviews Ive tried this on multiple occasions and this thing is SO drying no matter how much I put on It makes my skin feel dry tight red and borderline painful Ive applied maybe 6 handfuls of this within 30 mins of each other hoping itll set in and moisturize and my skin feels just as dry and more painful than as if I didnt put any on to begin with Definitely dont waste your money if you have dry skin because this is just glorified water with no noticeable benefits\\nread more Not worth the money because it didnt do anything Im returning it The face dreams and primer I love I didnt think an essence could make much of a difference in my skin but this item has helped keep my skin hydrated and soft Helps to boost effectiveness of my serums too Worth the money Beautiful packaging Im not sure If its making a difference But this is an essential part of my 7 step Korean skincare routine I have been using this for 4months twice a day Expensive but generous amount of liquid Will repurchase for sure This product made my skin sticky and the smell of it is horrible It also gave me more pimples I originally got this as a sample I believe and I immediately loved it I got this when I didnt have the best skincare routine yet so my skin was very dry oily and flaky at the time Nothing would help my skin texture at this certainly didnt help the flakes or anything but it did leave my skin feeling hydrated I didnt expect this to be a miracle product to save my skin but I could tell it would be great if my skin was repaired a bit I just knew I had to add this into my cart when I went on a skincare shopping binge And now in combination with other amazing products I can see the actual benefits from this since my skin has become baby smooth with a soft surface This hasnt caused any dryness or breakouts for me While this is great I can tell theres better out there After a long period I can feel my skin become oily and when my skin is oily I feel the slightest itchyburning feeling Overall i love it and the cons are tolerable I just use different moisturizers in my routine to balance it out I feel like if I used this both morning and night it would eventually irritate my skin\\nread more Love this moisturizer It soak in quickly and doesnt leave any residue Easy to use and perfect for me I love how it doesnt have that gross residue Just glides on your face Smell is pleasant I give it 4 stars only bc I dont think it really gets deep into your skin enough If you have extremely dry skin this is not the one for you AT FIRST I WAS LEFT A LITTLE SHINY AFTER I USED THIS PRODUCT BUT I STUCK WITH IT NOWWW IM LOVE IT I wanted a lightweight moisturizer so chose this over the lotion and this definitely did the job Ive tried better ones though so 4 stars Im still on the hunt for my holy grail but Id go back to this One of my favorite moisturizers but its not a winter moisturizer unless u have oily skin in the winter unlike myself I have combination skin type and half way through the product Unfortunately I am not happy with it at all It has made the rest of my skin extremely dry dull and flaky Where I live is dry and cold now so maybe this is the reason I am going to change into a more hydrating moisturizer ASAP Gel is not as hydrating as the original formula was Too bad Its probably more suitable for younger oily skin I use the Crush vitamin C gel cream and i LOVEE it  In general Ole Henriksen is really good So i bought this night cream without a doubt I used it once and the next morning i had like little red bump under my skin but wasnt sure if it was the cream so the next night i apply the cream again and the next morning my face was COVER without exagerration by huge and little pimple with white head and during one week the pimple kept popping I really donT know what ingredient this cream made me breakout like this but for sure i will never use this cream again\\nread more I can use this every night I dont really see a lot of result with it unfortunately and its very tacky I love many of this brands products so I will finish it up In hopes that it is giving me some benefit but doubt I will repurchase I wanted to love this but I had to return it after a month I used the goodnight glow and the serum together and the first couple weeks I saw no difference what so ever then I started to break out and even got red bumpsbreakouts on my face It was not getting better even with exfoliating It was not for me and I think the retinol alternative is the issue as I have retinol sensitivities and was really hoping this alternative would be better Still searching for my holy grail\\nread more Great product hydrating without making my skin oily I cant get past the smell its truly so unpleasant If you are sensitive to scent I would not recommend this at all Smells great and gives so much moisture A little bit goes a long way Skin feels so soft in the morning and Ive noticed a reduction in redness I cant get past this overly scented cream too strong too pervasive really dislike this Not good Broke me out and made my pores look huge The herbivore bakuchiol is waaaaay better than this The scent is STRONG Thats a red flag Anything w that much perfume will irritate the skin I had to wash it off within an hour of applying This one is a loser After trying bakuchiol multiple times in different products I finally threw in the towel and decided the product is not for me I am able to use all kinds if Retinol treatments but this caused my pores to look like craters by the morning and red pimples on my cheeks I had no reaction on my neck My face is finally recovered from the breakouts this caused so I wont be buying it and throwing away the samples I received from sephora I am seeing Im not alone with this reaction from this product I am very disappointed This product is too expensive to be this worthless I like Ole Henriksen products I have the truth serum banana bright moisturizer and the banana bright eye cream and now this night time moisturizer This night moisturizer is the lowest performing out of all the creams It did nothing for my skin When you first put it on your skin it looks amazing It makes your skin glowy because of the purple tint in it When I awoke the next morning all that glow was gone It didnt fade my dark spots It didnt give me an everlasting glow The texture was good though nice and thick Overall this cream didnt do anything it claimed to do Such a disappoinment and money wasted I would NOT RECOMMEND and would never purchase this product again\\nread more I have oily skin and this made me breakout like crazy everywhere Super disappointed because I love olehenriksen Will be returning this product This makes my face feel so itchy that it keeps me up at night Received the 7 day sample challenge that includes the day cream and have purchased this in full size but sadly had to return Its really diluted for something thats supposed to be pure argon oil I have loved this product for a few years now but recently i noticed a change  I thought it was just me I am happy to see others have noticed  I will be returning this product to Sephora now that I see more complaints Ive been using this oil for years and I love it but they changed the process and now every bottle has this rotten smell I tried to suck it up and still use it but was so disgusting I had to return it I wrote on instagram and Josies team replying saying they are using more natural process and it preserves the smell I can no longer use this until they go back to the old way of producing or find a way to get rid of the smell I have seen ton of reviews on Sephora and QVC from people who love this product but now cant use it because of the awful smell I hope they do something about this problem ASAP\\nread more I have been using this oil for years and never had a problem with it until recently Bought another bottle and the smell was pungent like its rotting I dont understand what happened Ive been using this oil for a few years and I love it But recently it has a smell I bought one in December and just opened it I couldnt use it The smell was awful The salesperson was great as she returned it yesterday Couldnt wait to use it this morning And this one too has a smell Not as strong as my last bottle but it isnt the same nonscent as it use be Im going back again today Hoping its a good one as I love this brand and product I do recommend it but without the smell\\nread more I have been using this product for years and loved it but the last bottle I received had a terrible chemical smell Trying to get a refund I have been buying this oil for years and the one I bought this week smells awful Not sure whats going on Ive using this oil for almost 3 years and loved it until I ran out of it and bought a new one at Sephora in Soho As soon as I opened the bottle there was a bad smell Never happened to me before I tried to apply it on my skin but couldnt pass the smell so strong  and disgusting So I returned it and bought a new one in Williamsburg but same thing The manager of the store agreed and said she will talk to the beauty advisor of the brand Please Sephora check with the brand and remove the bottles that smell bad  you cant sell a product like that It either means they changed the source of their argan oil  to go for a cheaper one or their product turned bad \\nread more I love this product but I cant put it anywhere near my acneprone areas which is totally fine Im giving it two stars because every time I travel with it it leaks like crazy I triplecheck that the top is tightly shut and it still leaks I thought maybe my first bottle had a fluke issue but it happened again several times with the second bottle Super wasteful and annoying to clean up Sadly I will not buy this product again\\nread more I had thick dry hair when I got a sample of this oil and it worked wonders After applying it to my hair it left it feeling nourished without feeling too oily or heavy My hair loved it but I simply cannot justify spending money on it after realizing how pricey it is If you go to a botanical store you can find good argan oil for a lot less than this and it will work as good Even though Id recommend it I wouldnt get it I got this for Christmas from my boyfriend this year and fell in love The product does have a weird smell may be what the oil smells like and it very very oily after applying it to hair and face SO DO not use a lot Also when I opened the cap the bottom lip followed with it and the oil got everywhere so I returned it to the store hoping it wouldnt happen again I went to open the new bottle this morning and the lip of the cap broke AGAIN It is very frustrating when you spend almost 50 on a product and the cap keeps malfunctioning Now it does not close properly and its very aggravating Hope the oil doesnt go bad\\nread more Being in my late 40s Im constantly searching for products to treat the fine lines right under my eyes and minimize the dry look I get with most undereye concealers Ive started patting this argan oil under my eyes at bedtime and it really seems to noticeably hydrate that area for the next morning Its too greasy to use right before makeup though and I still use regular eye cream on my lids and under eyebrows to retain firmness I also use the oil to smooth and soften flyaway hairs and treat dry elbows A little goes a long way in all uses Unfortunately I just got a bottle that must be from the bad batch other reviews have referred to and while it is thinner consistency and smells different it still seems to work the same as usual product\\nread more Smells terrible I have had several bottles of this in the past and my newest bottle smells like diarrhea or porta potty I truly cannot keep it on my face There must be a bad batch out there but when I went to return this the one on the shelf also smelled the same I usually use Perricone MD for sensitive skin as when I use some of the other skin products they irritate my skin I found if I used this product to close to my upper face it did irritate so I was careful I am 69 years old and do have many wrinkles on my neck and was skeptical I will say after just a week I do notice a slight difference I do use Perricone MD daily and swear by their products and was thrilled to receive this in a vox box to test and review by Influencer Mind you nothing will eliminate my wrinkles but they are softenedI am impressed It does feel wonderful when applied\\nread more Love this product Excellent neck and jawline cream I see slightly more definition and supple skin If I bring about jawline it does break me out the cream is very rich and luxurious Im impressed so far I received a free jar of Perricone MD Cold Plasma SubDNeck 2 fl oz in my latest VoxBox from Influenster I must admit its a great little neck cream Ive only been using it for a week but am starting to see changes in the finer lines of my neck It doesnt pill and has a light scent that dissipates quickly I cant wait to see the results when I reach the end of my jar It caused bumps on my neck so I had to use on my hands instead I bought two jars so I wasted my money I bought face eye neck and neck and chest Ripoff Each cream seems exactly the same I noticed no change whatsoever Im 53 so this group had a lot of areas to improve upon if they were able I do not get the hype over this I diligently used the entire large sized jar hoping to see something positive happen Absolutely zero difference TERRIBLE smell and super expensive Pass I decided to give this a try in spite of the smell mainly because nothing seems to work for the neck and at least some of the reviews were good I have now used half the jar twice a day and NOTHING has changed At least now I know this is a big waste of money Id return it but I feel like I have used too much I wont ever try anything from this brand again I thought my neck was hopeless but since the neck cream I had been using did nothing more than moisturize I decided to try this at the recommendation of a Sephora associate I had almost no expectations so imagine my surprise when I found that my neck had tightened up a bit and was looking less saggy I continued to use this cream  although the odor is really unpleasant  and found that very slowly my neck began to look a bit younger and less like that of a turkey It may not seem like much but Im ahem well over 65 and still like to look my best A little of this goes a long way so the jar lasts for several months Im buying another jar\\nread more Im 51 years old and I wanted to love this product I used it faithfully everyday for about 3 months and saw no results Maybe if youre in your 30s or early 40s not for 50s Not going to lie This stuff actually really worked Granted it took a few months for me to notice a difference I put it on every night before bed and when I woke up in the morning I would give it time to really see results but i promise it works Another downside is Im not a fan of the smell I bought this as a sort of oh gee I might as well try because Im afraid of invasive procedures Weeks later Im not the only one who can see a difference And I havent even come close to finishing the jar Atrocious and obnoxious vinegar scent made me nauseous and disgusted After application made my skin very sticky and gross all sorts of stuff was sticking to my skin The product works fine but due to the vinegar smell I wont be purchasing again Really havent seen any difference Feels nice smell is pleasant enough but no real difference This smells SO bad Ive been using it for about a month I have been using different neck creams for years and Im still in my late 30s So I cant speak to effects but the smell is so awful I dont think Im going to be able to finish the jar Such a beautiful product if you dont mind the price It made my makeup look melted together and flawless However the Morphe setting spray that is way cheaper does the same thing BUT if you are concerned about natural ingredients this is a great option I love love love the way this looks but the spray is so bad on it It will only spray on 14 of my face so I use a lot each day It does make my skin look amazing though I have combination skin and in the winter my skin gets so dry I love this in the winter bc of the dewy glow it gives me and takes away the dryness I feel in the summer it will be too much on my more oily skin Its definitely something worth trying I would actually rate this product 35stars It literally does what it says Gives you a VERY dewy finish lookHowever you can literally just buy the NYX dewy skin setting spray for less than 10 and have the exact same effect This is a nice gentle hydrating mist but I can get the same effectsbenefits from other products for a much lower price tag Dont really understand the hype This very expensive product feels luxurious upon application and sets makeup well but it does not make my skin look dewy or luminous After daily use I am finding that it makes my skin break out Love this product The only downside is it takes so much to give the dewy look and it doesnt come with much product which makes it expensive I still buy it but have to only use it on certain occasions due to cost Im not sure why there are so many good reviews This mist doesnt do ANYTHING I tried over makeup and under makeup theres literally no difference I look the same without it Overpriced and not worth your money a nice moisturizing mist I use it mid day especially in the winter months when skin dries out quicker pump spray goes on light so you can control the amount this like doesnt do anything im drycombo and on a bare face it makes me look shiny for a few minutes then its no noticeable difference it does even less to my makeup literally doesnt make my makeup look any different whether i spritz it before or after also two spritzes for your whole face i need at least fourfive to cover everything especially if im wearing foundation and its tiny as if its some gold in the bottle so im halfway finished with it and have used it maybe 56 times i wanna love tatcha and this packaging is to die for but the actual product hard pass i see better results with a jumbo 7 dollar bottle of evian face mist from tj maxx\\nread more Had high hopes for this sleek beautiful bottle Stay away if you have sensitive skin This product made me break out all over especially on my cheeks and around my nose where Ive never had a pimple in my life and Im a 50 year old woman Total disappointment and product going back I learned about this beauty mist from a blogger that I follow on Instagram She uses it to finish most of her looks and its really pretty on her skin I found it to be rather expensive for what it is but the reason I returned it is the smell I know others find this a plus but I really hated it Its an earthy herby smell Reminds me of patchouli which I also loathe not what I want to smell like But if youre a fan of those scents then this is worth a try It does leave a really pretty sheen on the skin The spray is ultra fine which I liked and the packaging is gorgeous I really wish Id enjoyed the smell\\nread more Solid everyday moisturizer Not as lightweight as Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream or TATCHA The Water Cream or Clinique Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief or LA MER The Moisturizing Cool Gel Cream The consistency is similar to Murad Environmental Shield EssentialC Day Moisture or clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion With Pump 42oz or LA MER The Moisturizing Lotion It truly is a lotion consistency Ive purchased it a couple of times It doesnt feel heavy or greasy It made a slight difference in my skins evenness of tone and texture In my opinion you need a serum peel or exfoliant for those results but it didnt cause any adverse reactions No breakouts No sensitivity No obnoxious fragrance Id recommend and a more budget friendly but still high quality moisturizer\\nread more Not amazing but great for the price point at keeping skin hydrated and dewy It goes on quite light and spreadable I still use a lot of product though I wanted to find something less expensive than the Volition which I love and sadly this just doesnt hold up in a New England winter It might be okay during summer but its so light and just does not keep the moisture in my skin I was really hoping to like this moisturizer since I used the Vitamin C moisturizer all summer and loved it But after three days of using this product my skin has never felt so dry My forehead and nose were flaking and I had to apply another moisturizer on top to help I have very dry skin in the winter so I will probably revisit this product in the summer Overall not a good buy if you have very dry skin Nice basic moisturizer Does a good job at moisturizing the skin but doesnt sink in as quickly as I like I find that it often times pills under my primers and foundations I have dry skin combo skin in the summer Tried this moisturizer out it wasnt anything special Nothing to really spend 40 on Its just a basic moisturizer Doesnt do much for your skin The claims are helps with evening your tone not really help with texture  nope  its extremely light weight Youll feel the silky smoothness of it when first applied but you wont be able to tell a different say come the end of day or after weeks of use Its literally just a plain moisturizer maybe comparable too a cheap moisturizer you could get from the drugstore\\nread more This is a very light moisturizer if you have dry skin this may not be for you This would likely need to be reapplied or mixed with another product Decent enough though Lightweight and hydrating but did nothing for my blemishesscars as many people swore by it Still not a bad moisturizer Its okay I wont purchase again Perfect for someone who likes light moisturizers I have dry spots so it didnt do much for me I love this product I finally found the product that is match in my skin I have very sensitive skin and prone to acne but from the first time I used this product my skin looks brighter and healthy the only downside is the price I got the full size oil in a box of other Biossance products I used this all the way and can honestly say that my skin didnt look any different after using it I have since purchased a bottle of sweet almond oil from a local store and that is working wonders for my dry skin at a fraction of the price Dont waste your money on this stuff I also agree with another reviewer that the pipette dropper should get out every last drop At the end I found myself pouring the oil into my hand to apply it\\nread more Very nice face oil The rose smell is not very noticeable which I appreciate I typically use vitamin C serums so this was an adjustment It feels nice on the skin and does give a glowdewiness However I am not sure about the reduction in hyper pigmentation I think the serums I used previously worked better It really depends on what you are looking for the product to do for your skin Overall nice product\\nread more Love the oil Truly a beautiful luxurious product Its one of the only oil ive tried that doesnt make my skin feel oily throughout the day It sinks in nicely and I personally think it smells lovely too Wish it didnt come in glass packaging as it just shattered on my bathroom floor i will repurchase eventually once i mend my broken heart and broken wallet Very pleasant facial oil that feel luxurious I do think it faded my dark spots somewhat and was very moisturizing Having a hard time with the price but would potentially reorder The oil is light and easily absorbed into the skin I really wanted it to work for me because I have been curious about this product for a long time Unfortunately I noticed bumps on my forehead and under my chin the morning after using this oil If something doesnt agree with my skin I either breakout or start to have textured skin with underneath the skin bumps There are other more affordable vitamin c products that work better for me so I dont think Ill using it on my face to see if there is an adjustment period I received this as a points sample and Ill use this up as a body oil\\nread more I received this product in this years Sephora Favorite Skincares Next Big Thing I love Biossance and was excited to try it but I didnt find this to be that effective I liked the tea tree oil a lot better I didnt notice any brightening effect from the vitamin C but it was still nice and moisturizing I really wanted to like this product I received it free in a gift bag Unfortunately I tried in a handful of times with the same result each time a very greasy face For reference I do not have oily or dry skin its fairly normal I didnt have a negative reaction to the product but it did not absorb well and left me looking like a greaseball the entire day even with makeup on top I normally love oil textures but this one is not for me\\nread more I received a deluxe sample of this oil in my Sephora Favorites Skincares Next Big Thing kit which I loved for the most part I used this for a few days and had a massive breakout that took me close to a month to clear up It was the only thing in my skincare routine that could possibly have done that to me I decided to give it one more shot earlier this week and used it for just one night The next day even after cleansing my face in the morning I had a bunch of small bumps on my chin and above my mouth that I knew were going to explode into pimples I could also tell that my skin was producing excess sebum That night I used a couple of tea treecontaining products and Murads Acne Control Clarifying Mask in an attempt to head off what seemed to be a massive breakout and fortunately that did the trick But the Vitamin C Rose Oil went in the trash Never again\\nread more Didnt seem to do anything for my skin I much prefer the squalene and tea tree oil but I have blemish prone skin Its very moisturizing And a lovely fragrance I use this overnight and wake with my skin feeling hydrated Im torn between giving this 3  4 stars At first I really loved the formula It felt good and my skin felt hydrated There is a greasy feeling at first but then it quickly turns into a smooth feeling as your skin starts to absorb it But now I dont think its worth the price Im towards the end of my bottle and still cant really tell what this has done to improve my skin Also the dropper is too small and cant reach the bottom of the bottle The dropper is also cheap Eventually the plastic squeezer came off and I had to start pouring the oil into my hand This isnt the packaging you expect for 70\\nread more I love this product I finally found the product that is match in my skin I have very sensitive skin and prone to acne but from the first time I used

seem to do anything for my skin I much prefer the squalene and tea tree oil but I have blemish prone skin I just cannot get past the strong fragrance It irritates the skin I did not find it hydrating  leaves the skin feeling dry after a while Its also not super easy to blend and would cause your makeup to shift Quite disappointing overall it illuminate the skin cause there is alot of glitter inside but doesnt hydrate very much i found my skin a little dry in the middle of the day and i have a combine skin that doesnt necessarly needs alot of hydratation to look nice The smell is horrible Мy husband refuses to kiss me when I put the cream on And if you put a little more it is not so well absorbed and traces remain as from an unsuccessful tonal cream The smell is the worst thing on the earth its like medicine I cant even tolerate it About the moisture is something that you can find with clarins la roche posay neutrogena olehenriksen Peter Thomas Roth this moisturizer isnt good I have received this product 3 times in trial sizes beauty points in a sample kit and as a reward with purchase but have never and probably will never purchase myself I love the product for what it is meant for but would never purchase this as a straight up moisturizer I do not think this has done or will do anything to benefit the moisture barrier of my skin It is filled with fragrance which I dont like in my skincare products I like the illuminating effect it leaves on the skin though which is why I still am giving it a good review I dont find Glam Glow products to be designed so much to benefit skin and more to appear pretty and trendy You pay a high price for mediocre ingredients and a ton of un necessary fragrance If you are looking for a nice glow in the summertime this looks great on its own or under a light coverage moisturizer\\nread more Truly the worst illuminating moisturizer Ive ever tried in my life I thought my first bottle was bad so I gave it another shot but both bottles let me down immensely I would apply to a clean dry face and no matter what I would do this product would pill on my face and the tint glitter would chunk up I tried this under multiple foundations and it was just so bad I dont understand how this product has received any positive feedback\\nread more Fragrance ruined it  I really wanted to love this and I had a sample which is completely different than the regular size I returned and used a cheaper  safer face moisturize I wanted like this moisturizer so badly but its not right for my skin If you have oily skin stay away It does great to moisturize your skin and add some illumination under makeup but it clogged my pores pretty badly I now have little acne bumps on my forehead from this Its not deeply moisturizing plus I feel like I have to use a lot to feel hydrated However I really like the smell orange cream and as I rarely ever use foundation or concealer I really really like the subtle glow from this Gave my skin a really nice dewy glow and was fairly moisturizing I really like this product I dont use it as a moisturizer though putting too much and all over your face will cause it to look oily and Im sure it will feel heavy I just put some on my cheeks before putting on blush What I do is put this on then I put Benetint and it looks great so glowy and natural Such a nice product on its own but it doesnt sit well under makeup no matter what foundation or concealer i use it always ends up pilling if i use this moisturizer under it I really really love this cushion compact I discovered it back in 2016 and have been loyal ever since For me I really hate feeling like Im wearing a lot of makeup even if I actually am lol and this is perfect for my dry skin and making me look more even and less red while not getting caked up on my face I love how convenient cushions are as well which makes this great for travel as well The shade range definitely needs to better though and the coverage isnt 100 which is why its a 4 instead of 5 for me\\nread more Just ordered and received single box with no compact  just one refill  for 60 Have been ordering this for years and should come with a full compact and one additional refillNot sure why Sephora changed this product I returned it to local Sephora store which did stock original compact but out of my color Store could not explain why this happened Pros This product stays in your skin all day and looks natural not cakey You can sweat and your skin will look still amazing It also gives you a hydrated skin look and glow Lastly cover uneven skin tone like some redness Cons This does not come of easy from skin This will require a liquid make up remover and liquid face cleaners and other products to make sure is removed This product actually has caused me to break out with in the one week of use and after a month and I have a lot small pimples and blackheads I wanted to clean the sponge which was difficult I started to press on a towel and saw all the product that stays in the sponge I tried cleaning as often since I worry the sponge with old product causes the pimples Lastly after a month the product in the cushion is almost running out but if you flip it and see the corners their is a lot of product left Once I finish this product I might not buy again I dont want to ruing my skin and be in a cycle of covering the pimples and making the pimples worse But yeah I still sadly likes this product\\nread more Has a subtle fragrance which I loved Feels like a premium product when applied Goes on smooth and gives a dewy natural finish Deducted a star because I would have loved for it to have a bit  wee bit  more coverage I have to layer it a bit specially on my nose and its sides as my skin is a bit red there But overall a really fabulous productthat too with sunscreen Its very light weight but doesnt cover much I have acne and red spots which this does not help to cover them I have to use extra concealer on top I bought this in shade 102 which says its for neutral to cool tones and it leans a little more neutral than cool Im an exact match to Cream in Hourglass Vanish Liquid Foundation but I can make this work and Im willing to do that for such high SPF I have sensitive combination skin and I felt that this looked great after the initial application Halfway though the day it started to become very obvious I do weird things when testing new makeup to see what will happen so I sprayed my face with water and used a tissue to pat dry To my amazement it revived everything and it went on to last the rest of the day with no further issues Before washing my face for the night 13 hours wear time I used a wipe and there was quite a bit that came off so it really stayed on well thought the day It didnt seem to transfer to any clothing or my baby he likes to pat my face For me this is great I live in WA state so I dont worry about this getting weird and starting to transfer on super misty days I also travel to CA HI and FL several times a year Id be using a refreshing spray in CA anyways but might be able to skip it in FL and HI Its winter so cant say if itll melt in hot temps but I suspect itll be okay Bottom line if youre very pale with a cool skin tone there are very very few options for high SPF products which is insane This specific color is not part of the Color iq database for whatever reason But if you match to Cream in Hourglass or are around NW1520 in MAC this isnt exactly perfect but its close enough its worth trying\\nread more This was a waste of money for me No coverage at all Comes out darker than the models shown I love dewy cushions but this just accentuates every little skin flake on my skin My husband said it looked like I rubbed toilet paper all over my face Regret the purchase First thing I noticed was that this oil smells really good Only need to apply a little to skin for each use Unfortunately it caused my face to breakout This product was very heavy on my face and made me break out Bought it because of all the good reviews and gave it a decent try but not for me Im not the type of person who uses a true facial oil every day because although I am dry I am also very acne prone This oil didnt cause me to break out like others do but I also didnt notice anything incredible about it However I bought a sample kit from YTTP with this in it and had a significant amount of the trial size left I recently started to mix it in with my foundation and WOW Life changing My foundation always looks really cakey regardless of what Im using and how much I moisturize beforehand But mixing in this before application CHANGED EVERYTHING My skin looked to dewy and hydrated with no dry patches at all Totally maximized my foundation and even my BB cream I will likely be purchasing a full size of this for use as a makeup oil and also for lymphatic massage\\nread more I really wanted to to like this product thinking it would be a good dupe for Biossance vitamin C rose oil but this oil broke me out each time I used it This stuff not only smells amazing and fruity it also makes your skin glow without feeling greasy One issue for me is that if I put any on my neck I break out Im not sure why but it works great for my face I live in a cold climate and have a dry peeling and irritated nose from the weather I use this oil on my nose and it does an amazing job moisturizing it as I can see the skin around my nose improving the next day I do avoid using it on my face in general as it does break me out I would recommend this oil if you have extremely dry skin I am super sad that they changed the formula it used to be my holy grail moisturizer and i am SO disapointed its completely another Product now Why did they change the formula  the last one was good This one makes me breakout Will not repurchase It feel really great however I wouldnt recommend for someone with dry skin who lives in a drysnowy climate in the winter My skin after 2 hours starts to crack I will keep the product to see how it performs during the springsummer time I miss the old formula This is too fragrant and almost feels diluted from the previous version still works fine but Id much rather prefer the prev face cream this seems cheaper and less beneficial for my sensitive skin I received this as a sample in one of my previous orders and I absolutely fell in love with it I excitedly purchased this fullsize version shortly after and I was slightly disappointed While it is still a very nice light moisturizer it is extremely fragrant much more so than the sample Despite the very perfumey smell it is still a nice formula that leaves my skin feeling smooth and not greasy if only it didnt smell so strong\\nread more Definitely great for Dry Skin like suggested For Oily order the Hydrogel Instead p I like the texture of the cream is not too light and not too heavy it makes my face feel soft I use it as my night cream I like the product except it has a light scent that I wish it did not have Im not sure if it smells like alcohol or perfume a bit but besides that is an okay moisturizer I have sensitive skin to some products but surprisingly it didnt make me breakout or irritated my skin I will finish the jar but most likely will not buy again\\nread more I bought off of a friends recommendation without realizing the formula had apparently changed I dont love heavy fragrance in skincare products and this smells like perfume I didnt notice this irritating my skin as some others have commented but it wasnt all that hyrdrating and pilled even when I used it on its own in very small amounts I would also not recommend attempting to layer it with other products because that makes the pilling even worse which is my ultimate skincare pet peeve\\nread more I used to LOVE this product but the new formula makes my skin burn and it smells like potpourri I will be returning it I wish they would go back to the old formula I am so sad to see the formula was changed and was hoping that it was just the packaging The old formula was my holy grail and I have been repurchasing for years The new one feels like a cream gel hybrid in a bad way Its thinner and a bit sticky and irritates my skin Whats worse is the fragrance It is so obnoxious and overpowering like slathering on perfume on your face So bummed Ill have to start looking for my new goto moisturizer Whyd they change something that was so great \\nread more Feels moisturizing but irritated my sensitive skin  I believe it could have been the fragrancenot a fan of the smell Loved the old formula so much the new one is not as hydrating has a plasticky feel and a very unpleasant smell smells like deodorant in my opinion Really hope they go back to the old formula eventually because it was my holy grail moisturizer Will be on the search for a new one now I use to love this product But the recent changes are terrible There is a strong perfume smell clogging my pores and causing breakouts This was my go to daily moisturizer now I have to find a new one Would not recommend Why change a produce that was so good something about the formula is different and it doesnt work the same anymore it now causes irritation on the skin now the previous formula was the most moisturizing perfect for sensitive skin moisturizer I had ever found now I cant even use it  im kind of afraid to use anything of theirs now because i dont want to risk the irritation i experienced with this one so ill use up the old formula of theirs i already have and sadly not rebuy because of the new formula they are using\\nread more Very loyal fan of Laneige Skincare however I really dislike the new formulation of this moisturizer It is way too fragranced I feel like Im putting perfume on my face The fragrance even lingers on my hands after application The old formula had a slight fragrance but so little that my skin was fine with it The new formula irritates my skin making it red and sensitive I was veeery hopeful this cream would yeild a similar result to the DRunk Elephant protini cream I have no idea why It is a great cream but its basically an overpriced I probably will just save my money and get the DE because my skin looked and felt much better Getting old is expensive I like it I dont feel like it is a miracle wonder but it does make my skin look calmer in the morning I use it with the redness serum from REN The only problem I have with it is that it sits on top of my face and doesnt feel like its sinking in Its not a texture I really like I found this product to be too oily Used the entirety of the full sized product and saw felt no improvements I found this greasy even when I only used a bit so unless you wash your hair every day this is not for you this product gave me at least 100 teeny pimples all over my face i do not have sensitive skin and i never break out from products im so upset and i wish i had seen another bad review that wouldve warned me against it TEST THIS PRODUCT before you use it on your face THIS BROKE ME OUT my skin was so clear and I woke up with tiny little pimples all over my face the next day PLEASE DO NOT USE I got a 5 ml sample as part of a VIB gift w the Ultra Comforting Rescue Mask This product is AMAZING 55 for product My rosacea is non existent and breakouts have been next to none since using this Only complaint is the size The jar is soo tiny for the price and it doesnt last very long Regardless I will keep using but wish the jar was bigger Love the scent of the black tea its comforting  relaxing very spa like I have been using this for about a month and I havent notice a huge difference in my fine lines or any tightening effects I have noticed a good amount of hydration though My skin is typically pretty oily but it has been less oily and I can only attribute that to this cream I use it twice a day Not sure I will repurchase since I havent noticed any of the claims\\nread more so sad i LOVE the black tea scent started with the mask so i wanted to expand and try other products from this line unfortunately this mask is not for acne prone skin broke out royaly so although it smells wonderful the perfume may cause irritation This is my main cream for the last year and a half I swap in others at least once a week Things I love its super hydrating absorbs pretty good and one jar lasts a long time since you dont need to use a lot of product Things I dont love it can congest my skin a little leaves skin lookingfeeling greasy at first and has some questionable ingredients I really wish this gave better results firming my skin I had switched to this from the lotus youth preserve when I felt signs of aging appear Im sticking with it for now but still on the hunt for my dream cream Using resurfacing night gels and weekly masks helps combat the congestion I rounded down from 35 stars that I wanted to give because for the price I think it should be better at firming and have cleaner ingredients\\nread more Doesnt do anything Tried it for a few months and actually bought a second jar which I will be returning asap Better off using a tretinoin and glycolic peel pads if you want results its going to hurt with a rich moisturizer Seems like a nice product but do not buy if you are fragrance sensitive Very strong scent that lingers when applied It may have a bit of tightening effect but I would not go so far as to call it corset like I only use on my neck for fine tech neck lines smells like the other Black tea products with I dont love but is not off putting either Perhaps I will see more results over time Still kind of expensive for no noticeable results This stuff is amazing Im in my 30s and I started dealing with lines on my decolletage since I sleep on my side and my skin wrinkles together and it looked horrible I wanted something that firmed it up and this did even better than I thought it would I am super satisfied with this product I am amazed by the results my skin is now smooth and the deep wrinkles are gone I have pretty deep wrinkles and pretty much now have very very faint lines The only reason for the 4 stars is the price but it is still worth buying\\nread more Another expensive cream that does nothing it claims to do Ive been using it as directed for almost a month now and nothing Waste of money I got a sample size of this and I always jump at the chance to try a product from Fresh This is a wonderful moisturizer I have dry skin and I found it to be on par with some of my favorite night creams as far as hydration properties go It isnt greasy at all and absorbs readily into my skin Im just not convinced that I could feel or see much of the firming effect in the time I used it I would be curious to know if Id notice any difference with prolonged use but the price tag on this is so steep that I cant afford to experiment with it I like the feel and the scent is lovely and perhaps this is worth a try if you can afford it\\nread more I received this Black Tea Corset Cream as a birthday gift It is a nice smooth pleasant skin cream It smells good but not strong or perfumey It works pretty well as a moisturizer But the Corset part is nowhere to be found A lot of the Fresh products Ive tried are like this Pleasing to use but no quick results And in my case I use it almost exclusively on my neck Sagging or loose skin and loss of elasticity are problems only on my throat and upper eyelids so I use Caudalie serum and La Mer Cream on my face For several weeks Ive faithfully used the corset cream on my neck and jawline For the bold claim implied by its name and the price I really expected at least minor results by this time But this corset aint pulled tight enough I dont even feel a minor brief tightening or firming sensation when it goes on my skin I feel nothing but a fairly lighttextured moisturizer The biggest disappointment is that the skin on my neck looks looser and less elastic than it did more than a month ago I gave it three stars for the nice scent smooth texture and moisturizer But the main attractionthat face corset feeling and results are completely absent so far I know there are much better skin firming neck and décolleté creams out there But since this is a brand that to me makes milder and gentler products with slower results I will be patient hope for any firming of my throat and finish the jar With luck Corset Cream is just a late bloomer that takes a long time to kick in If it doesnt start tightening skin Ill be heading over to Algenist Perricone or PTR If this Black Tea Corset Cream doesnt start showing any firming results I will not purchase this glad it was a gift nor try the eye cream that goes along with it\\nread more Left my skin feeling greasy and filmy I ended up having to use oil blotting sheets after applying The price is outrageous for the quality Glad I used the sample first I have always had these little bumps that eould appear on my cheeks every now again I have tried lactic acid treatments ahas tons of different moisturizers But nothing would ever seem to get rid of them I used this one time and when I woke up my skin was smooth All the little bumps were mostly gone Im prettt impressed I think this product is not for particular skin types I have combination skin with oily cheeks and nose and a dryer chin and forehead This product broke me out in my dry areas and made my oily areas sooo red and sensitive No improvement just irritation I love the way this makes my skin feel I didnt break out from it and I do notice a difference I am taking off a star because the smell is awful I am usually not sensitive to fragrances but oh my god I cant get past how awful it smells To me it smells like strong vinegar mixed with something that has gone bad I might be acting a little dramatic but I just really cant believe it smells like this lol I been using this one for a while now it is a great serum it really works but I deducted a star because in 18 away from finishing the bottle and it is almost impossible to get the rest of the product out I feel like I have 3 weeks worth but I cannot use it so minus one star because of that Thankfully I only got a tester because after the 4th day of using this I had to stop My pores are huge my cheeks and nose have hyperpigmentation and the overall texture of my skin is awful After the first two nights my forehead was finally smooth but eventually it just went right back to sandpaper I didnt really find it invigorating unfortunately just agitating Amazing product I have combination skin and uneven skin and this has helped my skin get refreshed and a glow smells like Elmers glue However I like the gel feeling on my skin and have noticed my skin clearer and brighter I bought this product because the research really astounded me Very impressive Though I havent really noticed a difference for myself after almost two months use so I wont be purchasing again I am using this product for almost 4 months now and havent seen any major difference on my dark spot or acne prone skin I would say it does creates a think layer for nigh face cream unfortunately it does not let the cream or moisturizer absorbs into the skin Thats a huge problem for me Its gets bit flaky and messy I would not but this product again and would not recommend it to people who have acne and pigmentation concerns\\nread more I dont have any acne once a month maybe a pimple but thats all I started using this night serum and my skin got so upset acne black and white head around my checks and forehead I used this with the 3 little wonders set and it was my least favourite of the three Whenever I would put moisturizer on afterward it would pill up and leave little flakes all over my face If the pilling was due to too much product being applied then the pump should be designed to dispense the proper amount as a single pump would usually give me more than enough to cover face and neck I didnt find this to do anything for me besides make my skin flake Smells weird and overall a big no for me\\nread more I used every night this for about two weeks It sort of evened out my skin a little but I felt it dry out my skin quite a bit even with moisturizer over it It may be a little bit too intense for my skin but it does make some difference I would not recommend for sensitive skin though Im almost done with my bottle of this stuff and Im just kind of eh My skin does seem a bit smoother but it really didnt help with dark spots or blemishes I feel like its a good product I just think my skin needs something different I think this product is not for particular skin types I have combination skin with oily cheeks and nose and a dryer chin and forehead This product broke me out in my dry areas and made my oily areas sooo red and sensitive No improvement just irritation I love the way this makes my skin feel I didnt break out from it and I do notice a difference I am taking off a star because the smell is awful I am usually not sensitive to fragrances but oh my god I cant get past how awful it smells To me it smells like strong vinegar mixed with something that has gone bad I might be acting a little dramatic but I just really cant believe it smells like this lol I been using this one for a while now it is a great serum it really works but I deducted a star because in 18 away from finishing the bottle and it is almost impossible to get the rest of the product out I feel like I have 3 weeks worth but I cannot use it so minus one star because of that Thankfully I only got a tester because after the 4th day of using this I had to stop My pores are huge my cheeks and nose have hyperpigmentation and the overall texture of my skin is awful After the first two nights my forehead was finally smooth but eventually it just went right back to sandpaper I didnt really find it invigorating unfortunately just agitating Amazing product I have combination skin and uneven skin and this has helped my skin get refreshed and a glow smells like Elmers glue However I like the gel feeling on my skin and have noticed my skin clearer and brighter I bought this product because the research really astounded me Very impressive Though I havent really noticed a difference for myself after almost two months use so I wont be purchasing again I am using this product for almost 4 months now and havent seen any major difference on my dark spot or acne prone skin I would say it does creates a think layer for nigh face cream unfortunately it does not let the cream or moisturizer absorbs into the skin Thats a huge problem for me Its gets bit flaky and messy I would not but this product again and would not recommend it to people who have acne and pigmentation concerns\\nread more I dont have any acne once a month maybe a pimple but thats all I started using this night serum and my skin got so upset acne black and white head around my checks and forehead I used this with the 3 little wonders set and it was my least favourite of the three Whenever I would put moisturizer on afterward it would pill up and leave little flakes all over my face If the pilling was due to too much product being applied then the pump should be designed to dispense the proper amount as a single pump would usually give me more than enough to cover face and neck I didnt find this to do anything for me besides make my skin flake Smells weird and overall a big no for me\\nread more I used every night this for about two weeks It sort of evened out my skin a little but I felt it dry out my skin quite a bit even with moisturizer over it It may be a little bit too intense for my skin but it does make some difference I would not recommend for sensitive skin though Im almost done with my bottle of this stuff and Im just kind of eh My skin does seem a bit smoother but it really didnt help with dark spots or blemishes I feel like its a good product I just think my skin needs something different Works nicely Were smooth and creamy Would use on slightly dry skin not on really dry and damaged skin Ok I bought the full size of this moisturizer with high hopes Murad products are known for quality and effectiveness Although this applies nicely and feels smooth and creamy on the face it regularly burned when I put it on I have dry skin that is very redness prone I bought this to rescue my winter skin Unfortunately for the first hour after I apply I notice my redness is aggravated and hyper sensitive That being saidI did notice a difference in the plumpness of my skin and a lasting dewy effect throughout the day I wish it was more suited for sensitive skin but it does reduce fine lines and plump regardless of the immediate redness side effect\\nread more I do not like how this smells Doesnt justify the cost I was really underwhelmed by this product I like to use an intense moisturizer at night and this one did just not work well with my skin I applied it after removing makeup washing my face and using my night serum and it did not soak in or anything it just kind of sat on my face I Used a really small amount but had to work it in for about 5 minutes just to get the white streaks to go away then I woke up the next morning to my face still feeling greasy I also got more blemishes or my forehead cheeks while using this\\nread more Dont waste your time and money Its just nothing 355 I have very dry skin and I like it Being testing this face cream for over a month now and its very moisturizing really help me combat against the dead winter Havent had any irritation or breakouts but keep in mind it has alcohol in it Also I dont like the packaging at all It comes with a specula which is good but still open jar packaging is the worst Im sure after several months all key ingredients will be long gone and image all the bacterias growing there Im very careful and always make sure to wash my hands thoroughly before dipping my finger or putting specula into it \\nread more I got this on sale because my skin is so dry from RetinA Theres no way its worth 75 It provides moisture for the day but putting it on feels awful Very tightdry feeling when applying it on my skin It also has a horrible chemical smell Get a sample before paying the price for the full size It also only has a shelf life of 6 months youll never finish it before it goes bad Smells super nice but it is only a 510 for moisture and feels bad on areas with lots of acne high key irritated my acne spots Would recommend to oilynormal skin types Feels good on the skin not too heavy but does moisturize well However the next morning I noticed small whiteheads around my nose and on the cheeks and forehead after using this Will return I dont like this moisturizer at all Sucks because I love organic skin care I thought this would be one of the best moisturizers ever because of the ingredients and the price but I was dead wrong I received this in a Herbivore sample package Glow and Hydrate with the rose mist glow mask and the Phoenix oil I apply my oil after my moisturizer since I have sensitive dry skin I have tried mixing it with the moisturizer and applying it before my moisturizer but I just get better results applying the oil after the rest of my skin care regimen No matter what this moisturizer just piled and flaked off of my face I hate it when a moisturizer does that because I feel an intense need to wash it off IMMEDIATELY It also smells like whiskey Very odd I wanted to love it but I dont like it at all I am glad that I tried this sample before committing to the full size I loved the rest of the items I received though I love Herbivores oils I use them in place of moisturizer at night time I have currently been using the Dr Jart spf cicapair moisturizer during the day For a better version of this I would suggest the Sweet Chef Moisture Boost That is the best moisturizer that I have ever tried Sweet Chef is owned by glow recipe and is sold at Target and is a clean skin care line  Loooove their kale hydrating mask The only downfall with the moisture boost is that it doesnt contain any sunscreen\\nread more Its a paradox Light in texture but sort of heavy on the skin I have extremely dry skin that always looks parched This moisturizes for sure but left a slight film that bothered me Felt like my skin wasnt clean I really like the texture but just dont like the after effect Wont repurchase I have never found a moisturizer cream so Soothing light yet effective My skin is normalcombo so I dont need a heavy moisturizer however it does get tight in the winter This product does both for me refreshes in the summer and moisturizes in the colder months Only reason why Im giving 4 stars is because I havent noticed much improvement in my redness around the nose which im desperately trying to target I will try this out with a combo of vitamin c serum and hopefully it will be more effective in that regard\\nread more Love rose water both for its scent and its benefits which is what attracted me to this along with reviews Unfortunately it caused me to break out mild and seemed a little too heavy I tried using it only at night and it still didnt work well with my skin  needless to say it didnt assist with redness or dry patches Im sure it would work better for others than it did for me  live in very dry climate but skin type is normal so that may be why it was too heavy for my skin\\nread more Love this cream  its light and super hydrating perfect for my dry skin even in the winter However it is really annoying to get the product out of the jar when you are running low Deducted a star for poorly designed container I love the Herbivore line but this stung really badly I think its the alcohol in it I liked the scent though Im sticking with the oils because I havent had a good experience with any of the creams not good for oily skin acne prone skin it broke me out very heavy maybe it is good for gals with dry skin good night moisturizer but too oily to use in the morning I really like this for winter Heavier cream that I would wear for day very dry cold winters cream is a must have during the day Its light enough to be used during the day and locks in moisture i have repurchased It had a really odd odor that was like paint and when I put it on it immediately stung after the only thing I like is the packaging and the constitancy This product irritated my skin leaving it red and uncomfortably tingly and I do not have particularly sensitive skin It is thick and feels thick on the skin It just doesnt perform as Id expect at this price May be nice on the skin but I can get over the smell like strong sunscreen Thought this would be a Miracle Worker It does NOTHING Waste of money dont get this All Overpriced moisturizer I was expecting something that was going to just WOW me for the price Thank god I bought the mini because I wouldve been really mad if I wasted my money on the regular size So many better options such as Philosophy Renewed Hope in a Jar or Belif Moisturizing Bomb Dont fall for the hype Really nice to be able to try this very very expensive product without having to go all in with the 100 tub This is a nice thick cream but very scented and a little irritating In the end I dont think I will be investing in the full size I tried once under my makeup and it was great an exciting and I looked glowy the next day I tried again just by itself with my serum and toner and today I woke up with a huge rash on my face my face its itchy and super red Im not even sensitive but this one was the worst I received as a gift luckily it was only the mini size would not recommend Bought the small size jar to try it out Cream is very rich and feels great on the skin Not sure its all that its hyped up to be but it does feel nice Its a heavy moisturizer best for winter Nothing particularly earth shattering about it even though I am a huge Charlotte fan Lovely slight rosy smelling product with a nice creamy feel not greasy and with a satiny finish However not recommended for large poresoily skin I have large pores and the satin sheen from the cream accentuated every pore into massive craters Really makes a girl feel lousy On the bright side I applied the cream to my dry hands and voila The moisturizer does a fine job of hydrating the back of my hands and the nice sheen adds a brilliant touch especially around the cuticles making my entire hands look hydrated and glowy Great product but not for my porous face\\nread more I loved the effects of the moisturizer at 1st even though its highly perfumed at the end of the week it went back I have combo sensitive skin and the fragrance needed up giving me redness If she where to launch a moisturizer without fragrance Ill be up for it Nothing special about this moisturizer that justifies this price It is very similar to the product in the big Cetaphil tub that is about 15 at CVS My skin type is combination and after using it for 2 days my skin broke out and I got 3 big pimples on my face I did notice an almost instant reduction in my fine lines However it is very greasy feeling and thick sunscreenlike Unfortunately when applied close to my eyes they will water for hours after Honestly I had super high expectations and Im glad I only got the smaller size I dont see any glowy or dewy skin at all and I dont notice anything except how thick it is I normally use Clinique Repairwear uplifting firm cream which I have actually switched back to I will alternate to finish this off My skin glows so much more and have that dewy effect Im looking for and I get way more product for the price Not impressed at all\\nread more I couldnt try this product ahead of time because Sephora near me doesnt carry it so I ordered online because I heard amazing things about it It was awful the scent was so overpowering I couldnt get past it I tried a bit on my skin and broke out immediately Ive already returned it Im glad that I bought the small size Felt like cold cream thick and ucky Worst moisturizer Ive ever tried I actually threw it in the trash then realized I could use it as a foot balm and at least not waste it I know that there are rave reviews about this moisturizer but it definitely wasnt for me If you like thick and something that smells like the cold creams of old it may be great for you Im inmy 60s used to have oily skin now dry\\nread more When La Mer was bought out this moisturizer was reformaluated and now does absolutely nothing Not worth buying at all Neutorgena hydro line is much better I got this as a gift and was extremely disappointed with the results that after 6 months of using it once in the morning and once before bed  sometimes i skipped one but at the very least once a day I do not see any major results or changes to my skin The biggest positive however is that it did not react negatively to my skin It did provide the moisture needed without being greasy or sticky and it sunk into my skin quite well Didnt break me out but really didnt do much either A little goes a long way and Im just now finishing the jar Im just glad I didnt pay full price for this and cant imagine how Id feel if I had and received these results Another thing to mention if its worth mentioning is that i mixed this in the morning with my SPF and it mixed and sat on my skin very well\\nread more Im a man with seb dermatitis and moderate acne Ive been looking for a luxury cream without the oil content that would flare up those conditions This is certainly luxurious It smells and feels amazing and doesnt seem to aggravate my seb derm or break me out Skin certainly feels very smooth and hydrated throughout the day A lot of skincare junkies will drag jar packaging but from all the research Ive done the preservatives in the formula will more than protect against bacterial growth and I bought extra spatulas online to avoid dunking my fingers Its obviously very expensive so I bought the large during the VIB sale to maximize value I really like it but once I get through this jar I may continue searching for something closer to the 100 range\\nread more Ive been using a free sample I got figured it was the only time Id be able to afford the brand and its fine Its smooth and feels nice Absorbs quickly without any strong fragrance My hypersensitive skin hasnt reacted to it Overall it is a perfectly fine moisturizer that keeps my skin feeling nice Do I think it is worth the price though Absolutely not Its not especially luxurious feeling it hasnt changed the way my skin looks and its not anything world rocking If you presented it to me without the name Id expect to pay 20 for a jar Youre just paying for the branding really and to me thats just not enough Its fine and Im enjoying using it but I would never drop the cash for the full sized You can get better products for less money\\nread more I was so excited to get his as a sample with my purchase DO NOT USE IT Within 10 minutes had dermatitis and it created breakouts I typically only get breakouts when I eat a lot of sugar and or on occasion I dont have very sensitive skin This product really didnt even give my skin enough moisture this is designed for people with combooily skin which I have honestly my skin would get oily after applying this so I didnt work for me  This gel cream feels like a heaven on your skin when applying However it made my oily areas oilier and failed to provide enough hydration to the skin on my cheeks Also caused a break out I was rather disappointed in this La Mer product I had received a sample of this a while ago used it and then tucked it away forgotten I was so excited when I saw it and couldnt remember why I stopped using it I used it one night woke up the next day with a few small bumps odd for my skin but I didnt attribute it to this The next night I used it again and woke up with a forehead scattered with tiny whiteheads I NEVER breakout like that ever Also my skin rarely reacts to new things so for this La Mer gel cream to make me breakout out so badly I cant help but to recommend you just stay away from this one\\nread more A very light feeling moisturizer If you have oily skin I think you will love this Leaves no residue or slippery feeling on the skin and has brightened my skin But i do think there are better moisturizers out there for me because i have dry skin Why reformulate when the original was so good STILL searching for a replacement this product is no bueno Left my skin oily which meant that It wont be an option for me in the future I tried it for a week and it didnt protect much against the sun either It also felt thick like sunscreen Product absorbs nicely and provides a SPF wmoisturizing base Easy to apply foundation after and it does allow absorption without competing for skin surface Only negative is that it comes in a tub vs a tube I prefer tubes for more accurate dispension and protection of product Love the consistency of this but like others this clogged my skin made me break out and caused dry flakes Also didnt sit well under my makeup and felt like my makeup clumped on top of it Not a fan even though I really wanted to love it I have hyperpigmentation so I try to get product that have SPF 30 This product is awesome because it provides protection and it moisturizes The texture is not too oily and not too heavy It deserves 5 starts however it is a bit pricy for the quantity Beware if you have sensitive skin I tried this out for one day and was broken out in blemishes all over by the end of the day It smells nice and has a nice consistency just unfortunately did not work for me I got a sample of this and it made my skin extremely red as if I spend all day in the sun I do well with a few philosophy products so I was excited to try this one The consistency was nice and it didnt affect the tons of green correction makeup I piled on It wasnt rigth for me Received a sample Awful just awful Burnt my skin Looks like I have a sunburn Would not recommend Breaks apart once you apply makeup Deal breaker for me This product left a film on my face that peels off when I rubbed my face Gross I bought this moisturizer specifically for the spf so I didnt have to layer one more thing on my face Your skin instantly absorbs the moisturizer and theres no greasy or tacky feeling The fact that its antiaging is a bonus for me Only thing is idk if my face is dryer than normal or what but it seemed to not moisturize me face enough Meaning that when applying my makeup under my eyes were still dry No issue for me as I still have Fresh Youth Reserve Combining the two leaves a beautiful finish\\nread more Good moisturizer Love the fact that it has SPF 30 Havent really noticed any anti aging benefits but overall good product I have no problems with paying a steep cost for a skin care product that is absolutely proven to be effective for me But I refuse to fork over my hardearned dollars for something that yields mediocre to subpar results for me This product feels nice and light but doesnt keep face moisturized long especially during colder dryer seasons For the price I dont feel its worth it Im searching for another spf moisturizer Kate Somervilles face cleanaers have been good for me so Ill see if that line has an antiaging SPF moisturizer\\nread more THIS PRODUCT MADE MY SKIN BURN each time id put some on my face my sting immediately causing me to brake out and my face getting red as well not worth the hype or the price going back to my aveeno or the drunk elephant moisturizer which is more on the pricey side but its worth it Smells great and my skin did seem to get brighter It didnt hydrate as well as I thought it would and it actually stung some of the dry patches on my face Dont recommend this for people with sensitive or dry skin my skin reacted badly to it and it cause whiteheads sadly Although this cream smells amazing I feel as though it did nothing for my skin During the summer months I felt like this made me sweat more so I used it primarily during the colder months Will not be repurchasing i love this moisturizer i have oily combo skin and this is the perfect light weight moisturizer it moisturizes my dry spot as well as brighten my dull spots but on the down side the fragrance is some what strong it has a very strong citrusy smell but its manageable I really wanted to love this because I love Fresh Smells amazing and its a really nice texture However was definitely not enough moisture Dries very fast and leaves skin feeling dry I am still trying to figure out if this product is for me I have mature skin that leans towards being dry When I use this face cream I dont always feel that its moisturizing enough It has a great nonoffensive smell nothing irritates my skinjust not sure if this is going to be a product for me I didnt find this product that moisturizing unfortunately the smell and texture are very nice and it feels great upon first application but after a while it leaves my skin wanting more much prefer my Caudalie moisturizer Its definitely moisturizing and helps with the dry patches near my mouth It leaves a slight residue that Im not a fan of though And unfortunately the fragrance gives me a real headache It doesnt smell like any kind of citrus to me  its just really artificial smelling like some kind of plastic Each time Ive tried using this in the morning Ive washed it off within half an hour Its that disorienting I received the travel sample size in exchange for some points from the rewards bazaar Normally I love Fresh products particularly their sugar balms but this is a hard pass for me\\nread more This is a fun product for glamazons who love playing with make up Id be buying this product in my 20s in my 30s Ive learned what works what doesnt and what productspractices are unnecessary this is one of them This offers a quick but fleeting squirt of moisture Thats it An hour later your skin is the same as if you hv have skipped this product all together Re moisture and supple skin Invest in good skin care not quickfixes As for primers I like something that glides over pores to minimize their appearance This does not do that Also has no bearing on the longevity of my foundation my Armani Luminous Silk does better without this step\\nread more Nothing very great about this but it just works fine Peimer does add a burst of hydration as advertised I wish it didnt smell like when I sharpen my No 2 pencil in school so far I like it I use it under my makeup and over it Bought this once and never again What is this actually supposed to do Because it didnt pathetic waste of money Its the equivalent of spraying your face with water The spray is good but its not world changing Its weightless and is in a good pray bottle but the smell is too much Smells like straight alcohol It didnt keep my makeup in plCe all day but it did stay on longer when I paired it with the primer I received this product complimentary for review purposes Overall this product is worth the money but there are a few cons I would like to let people know of first its one of those products that comes in oversized packaging When you open it you might be surprised about the amount of product inside for the large packaging but the product matches the amount listed and the container is oversized Second it tends to be heavier than other water creamsgels This is not a large con because its great for deep hydration and doesnt get too greasy at the end of the day but just makes it more of an overnight moisturizer than one for under makeup For a high level summary I have very dry and sensitive skin This smells nice and the fragrance does not irritate me but it can be a little heavy if you want to layer it with other products as I do Great for redness and deep hydration if thats what you are looking for\\nread more Went to sephora to get a heavy duty moisturizer for my dry flaky skin A nice salesman talked me into this one and Id say its just ok Wont buy again because of the price and the lackluster results Im really surprised and conflicted with this product I love everything Murad usually This product is a beautiful consistency makes my skin nice and controls my oil all daybut that FRAGRANCE its soooooo strong like straight perfume I normally dislike fragrance in products as it is because its a skin irritant and can cause breakouts or bumps but Murad is usually fine because the fragrance is very faint Not this though its insanely strong and smells like an old ladys perfume and the fragrance does not dissipate when you apply It stays all day and it gives me a massive headache \\nread more I love this It has a pleasent slight floral fragrance Its better for my oily skin type than clinique 72hour moisture aloe gel that one sits on top of my skin I wanted to love this moisturizer It was recommended to me by a Sephora salesperson after I told her I have slightly oily sensitive skin I used it for about 2 weeks A little goes a long way and this is great because of the price I loved the way it felt on my face  kept me oilfree all day long However it caused me to break out significantly on my forehead and this is the only product in my beauty routine that has changed\\nread more One of my favourite water gels so far Got a small one in a value set and fell in love I feel it actually penetrating my skin instead of just sitting on top and leaving it tacky unless you use too much Warm days Id just use this with an spf and colder days it works well with water and oil based serums A bit of tingling sometimes by corners of nose and mouth but never as irritating as other gels Also I see others saying it didnt give long lasting hydration but bear in mind its a WATER GEL Youre supposed to use another moisturizer on top\\nread more Not sure why the high rating I think the product is okay  dont see any difference however Every time I use this product I break out I tried it now three times and in the morning I always regret it when I wake up It feels amazing on the skin but my skin cant handle it Wish I could return it Not for me unfortunately I really wanted to love this but it doesnt seem to absorb It sits on my skin and peels off You do feel a rush of hydration upon application as you do with most gel moisturizers but I find that it doesnt fully absorb and it starts pilling and rubbing off It cannot be worn under make up for this reason The hydration feels very short lived It feels more like a mask that sits on top of skin I really wanted to love it bc of the Benefits it describes\\nread more I read through some of the reviews and it seems Im not alone Years ago I used this product and loved it Recently went back to it as my skin was dry with the cold months My skin turned red started burning and now my skin is dry and flaking off I dont understand what could cause this Very upset Great for oily skin especially under makeup Hella expensive though I use it sparingly for when I wear makeup during hotter seasons so that my makeup doesnt move This was one of the first higher end moisturizers I tried and I really liked it It really helped balance my skin and soothed a lot of redness I had from pickingweather It soaked in very well and left my skin feeling really smooth and soft Oddly I began using another moisturizer and when I came back to this I found it gave me a burning sensation and brought up some pimples Not sure what changed but probably wont rebuy just because I have new favorites now And I guess maybe it works better when its the only player in the game\\nread more I have really oily skin so I usually skip moisturizer altogether and stick to serums Ive started using this as a buffer when I use RetinA twice a week and it goes on silky and never leaves my skin oil I really like it I used this lotion a while back after desperately trying to find a moisturizer made for people with acneprone oily skin This seemed like the perfect fit and it was recommended to me countless times It was a decent moisturizer but unfortunately it didnt really work for me It didnt make me break out which was a plus but I also didnt find that it really helped with oiliness like I thought it would I may have to give it another go\\nread more I wanna give this 3 stars but with the benefits I do have they outweigh the negatives My skin is acne prone and sensitive so you can imagine how scared I was to try a new product It can be slightly greasy once putting on but over weeks Ive noticed my acne scarring to lighten up and my skin texture smoothed My only negatives would be the slight greasy feeling of the moisturizer and the several sporadic breakouts Ive experienced since using this product Other than that it pretty much lives by what it claims to do\\nread more I thought this would be a nice light moisturizer but ended up waking up during the night scratching my face My face was burning I went and washed it off but my face is now all red and swollen I look and feel like I have a sunburn I dont have sensitive skin but something in here caused a reaction that is just awful I love this product It has a perfect scent its not super heavy and you only need a little bit to cover your whole face and neck Oh did I mention that it also is one of the only moisturizers that helps with my cystic acne Cause it is Its amazing The only reason I wouldnt give it 5 full stars is that its a liiiiiiittle oily for my liking and I dont have naturally super oily skin so I really have to make sure Im blotting if I use this before I put on makeup for the day\\nread more Ive been using this product for about 2 months and I really havent seen a difference in my skin  I really wanted to like it but it hasnt really done anything new for my skin I have combo skin with occasional breakouts I also started to notice that my fingers are becoming really dry This is the only product that is new to my skin regimen so Im pretty sure its whats causing my fingers to become really dry\\nread more I used this on its own and then later in conjunction with the Time released cleanser It really threw it off balance and couldnt help but notice after 5 hours of just wearing it I felt like my face needed washed again So I washed and it left my chin dry and flaky but Tzone oily I tried it for a full 3 weeks and saw no improvements I really like this product for my oily and very acne prone skin Its definitely super lightweight and absorbs fast which is always great I think it works well under makeup but I can also see how some people would want more moisture for underneath makeup too I dont love the smell because it has a slightly chemical scent but I dont hate it either and Id rather that than artificial fragrance which irritates my skin It truly is a super lightweight and nongreasy moisturizer that provides a hint of moisture without being heavy or sitting on top of the skin It will definitely not clog your pores and it has retinol which is great for acne texture and wrinkles I do not think this will necessarily fill in wrinkles because the percentage of retinol isnt listed which makes me thing its minimal but it will help improve texture on the skin and will help to even out hyper pigmentation while providing a bit of moisture and without causing blemishes It is definitely not for those with dry or super dehydrated skin as it doesnt moisturize super well but for me and my oily skin its perfect Of course you shouldnt use this in the morning without sunscreen because it does have the retinol but I honestly love it both morning and night I think its an especially great nighttime moisturizer for acne prone skin since so many of us unfortunate cystic prone people cannot wear anything remotely heavy or overly moisturizing at night without causing problems Great solid product Do I think it will revolutionizecure all of your skin concerns No Do I think its a great moisturizer for oily skin people Yes even if its just used as a nighttime moisturizer in tandem with other stronger retinol products Will this fill in all of your wrinkles No but it will prevent wrinkles and help even out skin tone and texture without causing any breakouts Is it super moisturizing No but just enough for my oily skin\\nread more I was on the hunt for an oilfree and fragrancefree moisturizer and ended up purchasing this one It didnt irritate my skin or make me even oilier but Ive recently just noticed that it does have a distinct smell to it It lingers It took me a while to realize its this product that causing the lingering scent Im almost done with it but wouldnt repurchase I do like that its in a squeeze tube I read through some of the reviews and it seems Im not alone Years ago I used this product and loved it Recently went back to it as my skin was dry with the cold months My skin turned

moisture for underneath makeup too I dont love the smell because it has a slightly chemical scent but I dont hate it either and Id rather that than artificial fragrance which irritates my skin It truly is a super lightweight and nongreasy moisturizer that provides a hint of moisture without being heavy or sitting on top of the skin It will definitely not clog your pores and it has retinol which is great for acne texture and wrinkles I do not think this will necessarily fill in wrinkles because the percentage of retinol isnt listed which makes me thing its minimal but it will help improve texture on the skin and will help to even out hyper pigmentation while providing a bit of moisture and without causing blemishes It is definitely not for those with dry or super dehydrated skin as it doesnt moisturize super well but for me and my oily skin its perfect Of course you shouldnt use this in the morning without sunscreen because it does have the retinol but I honestly love it both morning and night I think its an especially great nighttime moisturizer for acne prone skin since so many of us unfortunate cystic prone people cannot wear anything remotely heavy or overly moisturizing at night without causing problems Great solid product Do I think it will revolutionizecure all of your skin concerns No Do I think its a great moisturizer for oily skin people Yes even if its just used as a nighttime moisturizer in tandem with other stronger retinol products Will this fill in all of your wrinkles No but it will prevent wrinkles and help even out skin tone and texture without causing any breakouts Is it super moisturizing No but just enough for my oily skin\\nread more I was on the hunt for an oilfree and fragrancefree moisturizer and ended up purchasing this one It didnt irritate my skin or make me even oilier but Ive recently just noticed that it does have a distinct smell to it It lingers It took me a while to realize its this product that causing the lingering scent Im almost done with it but wouldnt repurchase I do like that its in a squeeze tube Literally does nothing I even researched best use and I still think it was the equivalent of pressing overpriced water onto my face Looked no different felt no different did nothing This product works beautifully My only complaint is the packaging I wish it were in a pump Its a bit runny so you have to be very careful not to let it get everywhere and pour it slowly This product will last you a looong time I would say a year at least If you use it once a day Im referring to the 5oz WS excited to try this but made me break out So out it goes worked like a expensive toner for menothing huge difference Did absolutely nothing Refreshing yes so is cool water I have used the entire line for two months Advanced night repair for face and eyes revitalizing supreme plus the cleanser I dont see any change in the way my skin looks or feels Also I dont know where people walk around but strangers never come up to anyone and say you have great skin very tired of seeing that in reviews This is a great lotion to put on your skin right after cleansing It reminds me more of a hydrating toner than what I would call a lotion It is not greasy or oily at all I have sensitive skin and find this very soothing I can definitely feel and see a difference in the texture of my skin when I use it The only thing I would change is to put this in a spray bottle I dont want to waste it on cotton balls I just put some drops in my hand then apply it to my face I do wish for a spray bottle option\\nread more

because this last bottle seems different and doesnt seem to do anything I got a closed sample packet of this and thought it would be like any other serum Its the most perfumed and fragranced serum Ive ever tried It was an overwhelming smell and immediately started tingling on my skin in a not so great way I definitely wont be purchasing this I dont understand the need for the insane level of fragrance The top two ingredients are water and dimethicone as well I dont want dimethicone in my serums Way down on the list you can see fragranceparfum on the label WHY\\nread more I got this as a sample  I cant say that I saw a difference in my lines after one use but its very pleasant texture and my scum felt very soft after only one use Still debating if I should get the full size because of the price I bought this yesterday and have used it twice and can hardly get any product to come out unscrewed the pump and there is no straw attached so unless it is full you cant get anything I will be returning this For this price I should be able to actually use the product such a shame because I actually really like the serum I definitely wouldnt say its moisturizing its actually kinda drying But its good for me BUMMER\\nread more I wish that this sample had been bigger It seemed like a great productvery effective and feels good too I am going to try the fullsized product because I was so intrigued by the sample I wanted to love this product but it wasnt really moisturizing It also buckles when I put cream or foundation on top of it I thought this was amazing when first applied Instant results However my sensitive skin developed small bumps on the forehead  I stopped use before I developed alligator skin I got this sample and with only one try I can say I am sold But alas I will have to wait because its beyond my budget atm Sad  I received a sample and thought it was a pretty good product Not super moisturizing but it left a very pleasant texture and softened wrinkles Nice mild scent I thought I might give it a try but 17 ounces isnt very much for the price point I dont mind paying a little more for higher quality products but if I apply this twice a day as recommended this wouldnt last me very long Got a sample and could only manage one use because the scent is SO STRONG and perfumey  Im not willing to use again to see if it works My fave new purchase After I used the free sample had to have more Very dissatisfied for the price of this I have not seen any change at all Used for about 5 weeks and saw absolutely no difference either immediately or after I stopped using it It wasnt even worth the price tag for its moisturizing ability which was also subpar Big bummer and bigger waste of money After one use is pretty misleading Ive been using it for close to a month with no results It is moisturizing and I like the texture and it left my skin feeling soft but so many products do that already For the price I need something that works I received a trial sized bottle of this from The Bay in Canada as part of a promotion when buying another Kate Somerville product I used it for about 10 days and found no real difference either right away or in the longer term It has a really offputting smell as well and it doesnt really fade very much either as time goes on throughout the day I also found that it pilled under my foundation I was going to purchase this product and am so glad I was able to try it before hand I will not be buying this simply because I hated the smell\\nread more Got this a sample and I was surprised by how good it was for plumping and moisturizing I might buy the full size to see long term results I have a rule which I broke to try this product that is do not buy anything where you cannot see the contents Sure enough I got only 6 days use of this product which I paid 9500 This is absurd and shameful I received a sample of this with my recent order I was very skeptical that I would see results in one application so I was VERY impressed when I looked in the mirror Most of my forehead lines disappeared and my eye area looked amazing I could not stop looking in the mirror However four hours later and all my lines and wrinkles

nicely has a light creamy texture wears well under makeup and contains SPF What I didnt like it has a very strong citrus smell that is similar to Lemon Pledge it does dissipate quickly but I really dont care for citrus smells in my skincare It also unfortunately made me break out in tiny bumps which SPF products tend to do I was hopeful but just didnt work well for me If you like citrus and have more tolerant skin you may love it\\nread more I have use this almost daily for the past 2 years It is a great moisturizer Its creamy and a bit on the thicker side but thats probably because of the high spf My skins is more of the dryer side and it works well not sure it would be good for someone on the oily side I could say that my face overall looks brighter when I use it but it doesnt really correct spots at least not overnight This moisturizer hydrates my skin the perfect amountI use to use the tacha water cream before this which would cause me to become oily pretty fast I dont know if it has helped my dark spots It has a nice subtle smell and a little goes a long way I think it is just fine A lot thicker than I thought it would be which is disappointing Smells nice but not the moisturizer for me It is a really good moisturizer and the SPF is a major plus But it gets heavy tbh And its a major no for base make up Usually other moisturisers I use hold my make up really well but everytime I try this it just falls apart I even tried applying primer after and then foundation but the same result I have normal skin Probably the perfect winter moisturizer but too tacky and shiny for summer It broke me out where I sweat on the subwayso I got an upper lip break out It is a nice spf but feels more like one than a moisturizer Its a white thick cream that left me shiny until I matted with powder As much as I like the glow I was looking for an spf I can wear in place of my makeup powdered spf This unfortunately still needs powder on top as it doesnt really absorb I stayed pretty shiny Wanted to love it and may try the other versions of this in the winter There seems to be a couple different spf levels and age targeting vs brightening\\nread more Great cream for my dry skin Its been improved and does a better job at hydrating than it did before Only downside is the smell It has a nice fresh and clean perfume but it is quite strong and takes hours to fade out Youve got to love that smell normally i use dr andrew weil mega mushroom soothing cream and love it but this one dry my skin not foe me This cream caused a lot of pimples and acne on my skin after several uses I have combination type My mom tried too she has really dry skin with the same result in her 63 yo she had pimples just ridiculous for that price I like what it does when it says redefines your cheekbones and your jawline Ive seen a big difference in my face I love my contour now but this cream needs more hydration I feel like I need another night cream fore moisturizing My face didnt really love this I had high hopes as I really wanted a night cream to help tighten and firm The texture felt ok the smell was pleasant I suppose Not really impressed with the absorption and borderline felt a touch greased up at the end My face didnt love this no positive changes to report and possibly acne causing Ehhh I like some other Caudalie products Im going to return this and try Cru instead Fingers crossed\\nread more Good cream Helps with fading lines but definetly wash it off in the morning because I forgot and got some pimples Other than that great product I like it a lot I love how it leaves my skin i purchased this in the november 2017 vib sale after reading about the antiaging benefits of Resveratrol I decided to buy this even knowing with every fiber in my body that any antioxidants in jar packaging will be destroyed once its exposed to air and light hence you should always buy creamslotionsserums in opaque tube or pump packaging anyways after 5 months of use i really havent noticed a difference in my skin my fine lines on my forehead and under eyes are still there I have south asian dry skin and it really didnt hydrate it much either In fact in the evening my face always seemed sorta of drier after using this i would have to top it up with another moisturizer from paulas choice Anyways i say pass on this the ingredient list is wicked but its way too expensive for essentially doing nothing Must have been the jar packaging ugh\\nread more I use this in the winter after the Resveratrol Firming Serum and the two together make my skin in the morning feel so smooth and moisturized I think perhaps it might be too heavy for the summer months except for the very driest of skin Moisturizing but failed in the lifting area I typically like caudalie products I will need to find a different lifting cream that works Wonderful night moisturizer for sensitive skin I love that I dont wake up with dry cheeks It does a great job removing makeup as the first step of double cleaning However I must agree with other reviewers it burns my eyes terribly This is the first cleansing oil Ive used that burns my eyes So though I like it I wont repurchase not worth the stinging eyes I am a current Kiehls user and wanted to try switching to more clean beauty products So far I love every Biossance product Ive tried so when I ran out of my midnight recovery cleansing oil which I love I thought I would love Biossances just as much It is more product for less money which is a plus and neither stung my eyes Biossances doesnt have an overly strong smell but I prefer Kiehls What sucked for me is it gave me large pimples specifically white heads on my chin lip area and forehead Everyday I used it I would gain another pimple As soon as I stopped using it they all went away I tried going back to it and same thing happened Im super bummed and ended up returning it I dont know what ingredient did it to me since both have Squalene but like other reviews have said it did leave my skin feeling really dry Too bad \\nread more Not my favorite It didnt emulsify when water was added and i didnt feel like it rinsed off all the way I always double cleanse so its not a big deal but i wouldnt recommend to someone that just cleanses with oils This oil is really good I use it to double cleanse and it really cleanses my face without drying it out and feels very luxurious It does burn your eyes So when you use close your eyes tightly and be next to the sink I took a star off because it burns my eyes This cleanser has been great Im making the switch to crueltyfree only and needed a new cleanser to remove my makeup at night It never stings my eyes or leaves my skin feeling overly dry or tight after Ill definitely be repurchasing Tried this at Sephora and liked it a lot particularly since its a clean and cruelty free brand Used it for two weeks and it broke me out Apparently its too much for my sensitive and oily skin Had to return it While this is decent at cleaning makeup it smells and feels like acid in my eyes Would not recommend if you dont like strong fragrances or have sensitive eyes I love this as part of a cleansing routine that doesnt involve removing eye makeup It plays well with my dry sensitive skin it dissolves makeup beautifully Whether its the oil or the breakdown of eye makeup by the oil  I agree with reviewers who say it burns Im using it up but wont repurchase I bought this product specifically to double cleanse my face as I use waterproof mascara This product stated that it does remove waterproof makeup I actually had to stop using this and couldnt finish it as it burned my eyes so badly every time I attempted to use it to remove my eye makeup It worked fine on the rest of my face but kind of a waste since I bought it to remove my eye makeup Ill be switching back to the farmacy balm\\nread more 1st Biossance product I like it and it cleans well bit stings the eyes It does a great job removing makeup as the first step of

have combo skin with an oily tzone and I just felt like it didnt really do much to my skin I think for more oily skin types it would do wonders because it just didnt give me the hydration that the rest of my face needed It kept my tzone hydrated without being greasy but the other areas of my face were dry So completely oily skin types this is for you I liked this oil free gel cream but it didnt blend too well and took forever to blend and soak into the skin I wouldnt mind trying it out again I just prefer the ultra facial cream instead it just feel better on my skin One of the best products for anyone with oily skin It keeps your face supple and moisturizer with none of the sticky feel Can be used all year too Well I have only been using this product for 2 weeks it seems that if it moisturizes my skin  I like that the skin absorbs it quickly and is not heavy I will not lie saying that I do not get oil the truth is that if I continue to get oil especially from my forehead but it is that my T zone is surprisingly greasy and what I have noticed is that I have less oil in my T zone but I continue With oil it is in this area but in smaller quantity\\nread more This totally did not work for me It smells strongly of alcohol when applied and then caused stinging on my skin I need something that wont aggravate my pityrosporum folliculitis but it didnt work for me I am using differin as well but havent reacted to much else this way this was very irritating contains lots of alcohol not very moisturizing and left a tacky film on my face It also caused me to breakout Ive used gel moisturizers in the past and never experienced this awful texture before Definitely for oilier skin types left my face feeling really dry and tight and there is a faint smell of alcohol in the cream which could account for the dry feeling Dont use if your skin is on the normaldry side It is a refreshing gel texture just not suitable for my skin type This product is just ok its not moisturizing enough for my liking My makeup goes on nicely on top and it does not irritate my sensitive skin If youre looking for a moisturizer that has minimal to medium moisture this would be ok for you Terrible breakout Red blotches all over my face after a continued use for two weeks Recently have stopped use of all moisturizers to ensure this was the cause of breakouts and it was Feels really light on my skin But it is not misturized enough for me I dnt like this product at allits says suitable for combination skin and I have same type it didnt worked at all by using tht my skin got dryer n flakey worst moisturizer ever Super disappointed in this oil  it had some great reviews but did not work for my skin at all My skin is usually pretty clear but after only using this for a week I broke out like crazy I didnt like the smell and since I threw out the receipt I couldnt return it I have been using it on my hands so it doesnt go to waste  but even then it isnt doing better than most of my hand cream Not as moisturizing as i hoped for It imparts a nice glow initially best to add a moisturizer on top to seal in the effects It is nice to put on right after cleansing your face in the morning Cleared up my skin Loved the texture of my skin This doesnt replace face oil with vitamin c to improve the dullness I picked up this after getting a perk facial and broke college student skeptical me said yeah Ill return this after two weeks Well reader I couldnt thats how much it changed my skin I only put it on at night and sometimes on my scalp because I have a dry scalp Probably wouldnt buy this again for the PRICE TAG but enjoying every drop while it lasts I had used many different kinds of facial oil and this one didnt impress me The scent is a bit weird and I dont feel it keeps my face moisturized overnight Tried a couple of times and broke out everytime so I had to return I didnt feel any positive result too but I hadnt used it long enough I mistakenly bought this toner instead of the brown one with the rose petals and liked it so much I decided to keep it The spray nozzle is easy to press and very fine mist It made my skin feel hydrated and not too heavy on the rose scent For the price I dont feel like this toner gives much in terms of results but it didnt break me out either Get the rose petal one instead for major hydration Burns my face Have dry skin and it further seems to wick away moisture Never buying again One of my favourite sprays I was gifted this about 2 years ago and had consistently been using it until a couple months ago Smells amazing is incredibly hydrating and does not leave your face feeling sticky Aside from being a bit on the pricer side its incredible However I wish Fresh was a cruelty free brand  which is why I have not repurchased No no no this is horrible I couldnt make it even through one use cause it burned like the dickens Stay away far far away I am always looking for new toners and I generally love Fresh products so I had high hopes for using the generous sample that I received I used the entire sample but was so uninspired by it It made no difference in my skin and I think I would have been fine without it This toner smells nice and moisturizes well However I am not a fan of the cost so I am trying some other toners that are as nice but a bit more affordable Love the toner smells great feels great not sticky but the little spray bottle doesnt mist Its a pretty concentrated atomizer so its kind of hard to gently spritz your face I like their smell It s so fresh But it makes my skin breaks out so bad and stingy after spraying I ended up returning it I am astonished there are not more reviews about the strong smell maybe Im missing them In any case I knew by a single whiff that this was not for me IMO any product with rose in it is hit or miss because it is one of those scents that can easily come off as overpowering One of the possible culprits in this that makes it too strong smelling is the addition of chamomile flower extract ie Anthemis nobilis The advertised strengths of this toner would be its cooling sensation and gentleness which sounds appealing However I couldnt bring myself to spray on my face If you are leery of heavy scents I strongly suggest sampling on a cotton ball or something other than your skin I received this in Play\\nread more I wasnt a huge fan of this I bought it as a day toner but i just felt unimpressed I ended up also getting the Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Toner and I actually love that one a lot more Even as a refreshing spritz through the day it was eh also didnt like the sprayer on it Overall product is not bad just your typical rose water sorry The spray bottle itself is not good quality at all The spray is not a fine mist like other comprable products It basically squirts water on your face I mistakenly bought this toner instead of the brown one with the rose petals and liked it so much I decided to keep it The spray nozzle

super noticeably effective but I enjoy the feeling of it and would repurchase to buy into the de puffing and cooling gimmick It does feel cooling and moisturizing on the skin Only problem is that it drags and pulls your skin around which is bad for under the eyes This product gave me a horrible reaction Day two and you can see red raised and textured hot tracks wherever I rolled this across my skin Feels like a horrible sunburn Using antihistamine and topical hydrocortisone but still very uncomfortable I have never reacted to anything before My skin type is drydehydrated I tried it for 2 months and didnt see a difference it just feel like water but does anything DIDNT LIKE IT STILL REALLY DRY AFTER APPLY ON SKIN  It feels very refreshing but doesnt do anything to help with eye bags or wrinkles Feels nice to put on and is pretty moisturizing I just dont see any of the depuffing effects At first it gives you a nice cooling effect but it broke me out after a few uses I noticed small bumps under my eyes and immediately stopped using the product A friend of mine had the same reaction I also dont think its worth the price its a very basic product and it would be better if it wasnt in stick form Continuously rubbing a product on your skin makes it a breeding ground for bacteria If you have sensitive or acne prone skin please avoid\\nread more Its nice and cooling but I find it kind of unnecessary If you have some money burning a hole in your pocket go for it If youre a crier this is a great product As odd as it sounds it is great for getting rid of redness and puffiness after crying I am a stressangry crier and it is perfect when I need to calm my face down So if you know youre prone to crying or going to see a sad movie and expect crying throw this in your purse and use it right after This product feels really nice when I apply it but there is no discernible difference in my undereye puffiness after using it I will continue to use what I have on mornings when I feel extra tired or after crying just because it feels good and cooling But I would not purchase again Mine is defective and will not allow for the product to be screwed up I enjoyed it a few mornings after late nights and liked the cooling sensation but it leaves a tacky residue that was not appealing to me I bought this for my mother after she asked for something to help depuff her under eyes She gave it back to me after a week of using because it simply doesnt do anything It doesnt moisturize or cool I dont know if they changed the formula or not but I remember being amazed with how cooling it was when it first came out After getting this back from my mother I can confirm that it really does nothing Im so upset that I spent THIS much money on a cream that didnt do anything for my skin I used this for 6 months and didnt see any difference other then a little bit of moisture I havent been impressed with dr Dennis gross brand it has taught me you dont need to spend so much  on skincare for results My skin loves Retinol  This is a beautiful light weight moisturizer It feels rich and layers well under other products  no pilling The smell is soft and nice This product doesnt last as long as I would like so because of that I would give it a 4 star rating I would buy it again First full disclaimer I havent used this product I cant speak to its effectiveness I read the description and was so ready to add this to my cart Its exactly what Im looking for a moisturizer with retinol to use at night so I dont have to do two different steps and its from a brand Ive used before and really like Then I looked at the ingredients Dimethicone is the SECOND ingredient on the list Seriously I try to avoid silicones in my skincare when I can because they can be poreclogging and there is some evidence to suggest silicones can be bad for the water supply but Im not necessarily a huge stickler about it That being said I would never use a moisturizer where a silicone is literally the second ingredient Silicones are great in primers because they fill in your pores and help give your skin that silky smooth texture Why in the world would I want to fill in my pores before bed And so my hunt for a nighttime moisturizer with retinol continues\\nread more This is not worth the price It isnt moisturizing and feels like it just sits on the skin and doesnt absorb First off let me tell you that I have sensitive acne prone skineven in my early 40s and was looking for something that would help with my fine lines in my forehead and eye area but one that wouldnt break me out This cream is amazing I have had no sensitivity to it from night one No acne breakout and over the past several weeks of using this my eye wrinkles have become less pronounced and my forehead wrinkles have become less noticeable It leaves my skin hydrated and with a nice soft glow I have combination skin and has not caused me to be oily I am very impressed with this moisturizer and would recommend it I searched for a good cream that had the right ingredients to help with aging skin and this one hit almost all the pertinent ones Only taking 1 star off bc I wish it wasnt as pricey but you get what you pay for an I realize that there are a lot more expensive creams out there then this one So go ahead and try it I do not think you will be disappointed\\nread more The ferulic  retinol combination complements the DDG peels and serum really well I love it when Im using the pads because it amplifies the benefits and I dont have to worry about interactions on my sensitive skin but I dont love it enough to buy on its own Im using their serum version for night time and this was just too heavy to add on day or night Perhaps in winter My skin kept sagging and wrinkles did not diminish at all not even skin spots decreased I stopped using it after 3 weeks Any inexpensive moisturizer did more that this product Awesome for renewing skin I love most of this product line however my face became too dry and flakey using this Perhaps the retinal was not a good match for my skin I wanted to exchange but I had a 20 off card which Sephora was not willing towards another product So I just got my discounted refund and walked out I got this a while back in a Play box and finally got around to using it when I ran out of makeup remover and was too lazy to restock The oil was solid when I opened it which I prefer but the lid arrived a bit loose and had leaked around the rim and made for a messy first use I scrape the product out with the back of my nails though a spatula would definitely work better and the heat of my hands melts it in seconds Works ok removing foundation and regular eye makeup but I have to run my fingers under the faucet a couple rounds and gently rub my lids to get liquid eyeliner and mascara off completely Since rinsing leaves a layer of gunk I follow up with a foaming cleanser I have dry skin so it doesnt make me break out nor does it feel pore clogging with double cleansing Prob works better as a body moisturizer but for the price vs size of a jar I have other goto brands Similarly there are much better clean makeup removers that Sephora carries Might be nice to travel with if carrying on since its multipurpose\\nread more I got this as a sample and was super excited to try it but it didnt melt as beautifully as makeup remover oils do like the banila one and there were little balls of hard coconut oil pills left in my hand after It also didnt remove all the makeup I had on my face It worked ok as spot treatment for dry spots on my body which is what I use it for now Just coconut oil I feel personally like its not worth the price for the quantity of the product Coconut oil is now in lots of products Kind of greasy but ok I cant review the product itself because I cant get over the smell yes its coconut so I do expect a slight smell but this was way too much coconut for me So overpowering that it will overpower any other smell you have on I will preface this review by stating I do not own this product BUT please just look at the ingredients list This is literally just overpriced slap a pretty logo on it coconut oil The ONLY ingredient is coconut oil You can buy it anywhere else for soooo much less money Dont waste your hard earned money on this There are way more fun products to blow your money on at Sephora Please treat yourself to literally anything else\\nread more This is such a rip off Its only ingredient is coconut oil You can get it for much cheaper at other places instead of paying 40 for a name I received a sample of this a while ago and I really loved it for my bra length platinum processed hair It applies really well and smells great so I ignored the negative reviews and purchased the mini for myself It is literally a deluxe mini sample for 18 NO WAY am I willing to pay that Requested a return immediately I love the Kopari in packets but the melt in the jar or tube is IMPOSSIBLE to use It is rock solid in the jar and impossible to squeeze out of the tube Hard to get out of the jar and pretty greasy Although it does leave my skin soft As a product it works but so does the organic coconut oil I bought from Stop and Shop I got this as a sample used it because why not and got the same results I have gotten while using organic coconut oil I bought from the market They say their coconut oil is special its just from a Philippines Coconut oil as a moisturizer I highly recommend  just save yourself the pretty packaging  I dont know why the packgers needed to test dozens of coconut oils to find

skin and I do not need a primer as this moisturizer acts like a primer if i ever do put foundation on After trying it without priming my oily face for a good weekit did not do me any justice So far a three star for me because it does keep my oily face at bay when i apply primer with it It feels nice on my skin and keep my acne at bay\\nread more I bought this moisturizer on the recommendation of a store employee I was looking for a heavier moisturizer for the winter This moisturizer is easy to blend Into the skin but I find it pretty light  medium so not what I was looking for but I use this almost everyday still Im allergic to glycerin and this product is glycerin free which is great It has no overpowering scent to it This was just ok to me I have normal skin and its a nice general moisturizer I liked the scent but will always prefer something without Again I liked it didnt love it Its expensive for what I got out of it My waxologist convinced me to buy this product as I told her I dont regularly moisturize my skin I really liked it at first and liked the smell However I dont notice that it really moisturizes my skin much Also worst for me is after about a week of using it it begun to burn my skin whenever I put it on Moisturizes well enough but it broke my skin out I find the texture being unique its a cream with a bounce to it cushion indeed The moisture power is strong and was enough for my combo skin Didnt conflict with other skincare layers I deduct a star purely for the price Ive been using this product for about a month now and love the lightweight texture but I dont find it quit moisturizing enough I dont have very dry skin and it works well for everywhere except for my drier problem areas under the nose and between my eyebrows which I found still got flaky Probably wouldnt purchase again So strongly scented this is too much fragrance to even put on my body let alone my face Would not repurchase A dermatologist brand should know better and do better I wanted to try other things from the brand since I love the peel pads but this Broke me out really bad No bueno Really disappointed This product its great on my oilycombination skin Before I used this moisturizer I struggled a lot with excess oil in my tzone but since starting this moisturizer I noticed that my skin feels softer does not get as oily and is overall more even I highly recommend this product if you struggle with oily skin and need a moisturizer that doesnt clog your pores Its light weight and makes your skin super soft Also it has a light smell\\nread more I love the midnight recovery oil so I had high hopes for the daytime one This oil did not do anything for me It is very very light and it doesnt feel like it goes a long way I feel like I need a lot of be bale to spread it evenly over my face Nothing special I know Vitamin C is good so I keep using it after a sample Every time I have used this a cystic breakout comes within a day or two My skin doesnt play well with essential oils as I am very dry and sensitive This may work for someone who does not have dry skin or sensitivity Breakouts almost immediately Not for my skin but may be good for drier types I have been using this product for a little over a year now and while I certainly think its nice  it smells great it sort of wakes you up in the morning its moisturizing  I can honestly say that when I forget to put it on or am too lazy to apply anything extra beyond my day time moisturizer and sunscreen I dont notice a difference I have normal to dry skin and on days that Im dry I dont feel like this does anything magical or extra to help Its a crazy good value I still have a ton left but I dont think Ill be repurchasing right away\\nread more I love the midnight recovery oil

makeup without a primer Only lost points on price So glad to see Sephora carrying this product This moisturizer feels like silk on your skin not a bad product but OMG  what kind of packaging is this It is the weirdest thing to open up and use Bizarre Probably wont buy again unless the cream is exceptional Funny no one has mentioned this Ive been buying this moisturizer for years now but my most recent container of the hydra gel isnt right Either the changed the formula or Ive just noticed the difference after years of use but it smells like heavily perfumed alcohol I used to think that the smell of this moisturizer was pleasant but now its almost overbearing I used to love this but now it is no longer worth the price I fell in love with this moisturizer when I received a sample It feels luxurious and soothing on my face which is often irritated from being treated with a prescription retinoid Some of these hydragels are almost too watery and take forever for your skin to absorb This goes on really smoothly and quickly My only criticism is the price point  I would never pay this much However I DID ask for it as a gift  and Im really happy my husband bought it as a birthday present\\nread more As Im writing this Im still in shock Im spending 100 on a moisturizer But its THAT good I got it as a sample and fell in love I only use it during the day I like using thicker creams for nighttime and the results were still visible Its light leaves you glowing  dewy all day  does not clog pores I highly recommend this product Ps I have combination skin more on the oily side This moisturizer did not add to oil It actually gives you a healthy dewy glow\\nread more Very light and watery texture Does not have a scent which is good but I didnt notice any major difference in the staying power of my foundation Its too pricey for the results ive been really loving the milk makeup hydro grip primer and when i ran out i decided i would try this because why not i ended up buying my milk one again because this one made my dry skin really flakey i see how it might work for people with normal or combo skin but it just didnt work for me Leaves residue on my skin and peels when I try to apply anything on top of it or touch my skin This felt so nice on my oily skin like a cooling lotion that made my skin smooth as glass It made my foundation go on like a dream However after a while my skin started to itch When I took my foundation off at the end of the day my face was covered in tiny breakouts My foundation looked flawless but my skin hated it so I wound buy again I would recommend this for oily skin I received this as one of my free samples and applied it this morning It made my skin feel very tight but I figured I would give it a chance When I attempted to apply makeup it was a mess My skin is kept moisturized and has been nice and soft but it felt dry and tight and even looked scaly in places Not for me I didnt purchase this item on Sephora It does not help my foundation last longer at all The only reason why Im giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it works fine as a daytime moisturizer for me Not for oilycombination skin I sincerely hope that people notice that when you buy the full size youre actually paying 1200 more for nothing two of the mini sizes make up one full size Youll end up paying 3000 instead This is a bizarre reversal of sizing up for value I used to love this product  then one day it no longer worked well for me used to love this but after using for a while caused my skin to get cystic acne and clogged my pores very hydrating but does not leave my skin feeling clean or refreshed I dont like the consistency of this oil at all The other reviews are not lying It feels like literally applying honey on your face Very thick oil and doestt come off easily either I gave it one star because it smells good Dont like this product at all It is VERY heavy difficult to spread around without doing a LOT of pulling Wouldnt recommend it I bought this from a sephora located inside a JCPenny bc they didnt have my norm the sales clerk recommended I love josie marano products the price for the size of the bottle was very appealing Unfortunately I hated it maybe I used it wrong it was sticky instead of feeling like an oil and didnt really take anything off returned it and bought my biossance cleansing oil I love the scent but after using as directed my skin feels taught Seems strange for something made with oil Im returning this one Ive used cleansing oils before that feel smooth being applied to dry skin and foam when water was added This does that except instead of applying smoothly it sticks like glue or honey glue to your face hard to massage in This is okay but not what I wanted The good side usually oil cleanser makes my skin dry But this one doesnt lose moisture on my skin Usually when I use oil cleanser they make my skin dry But theres still cons I need to take little more time to make sure the makeup is totally removed Ive seen it mentioned in other reviews and I understand everyones frustrations now With washing my face like I normally have done for years this one always got in mouth and tasted horrible Ive never had this experience with any other cleanser I tried avoiding the mouth area and it still happened and Id have to spit it out I also wasnt impressed with its ability to remove eye makeup which was my main reason for buying an oil cleanser My makeup was waterproof liner and regular mascara all it did was smudge it around and not help rinse it all off I wasnt a fan of the citrus fragrance though that might be a plus for some Ill be returning this unfortunately\\nread more I absolutely love this product You really get what you spent It leaves your skin really smooth after each use It is a great cleanser However if you have very dry skin it may not work for you but work well for any other type of skin used to love this but after using for a while caused my skin to get cystic acne and clogged my pores very hydrating but does not leave my skin feeling clean or refreshed I dont like the consistency of this oil at all The other reviews are not lying It feels like

you spent It leaves your skin really smooth after each use It is a great cleanser However if you have very dry skin it may not work for you but work well for any other type of skin I wouldnt buy again Im an essence snob and have this two good tries Its obviously good and good quality But WAY too expensive for what it really is Tatcha is another premium yet much cheaper essence Idk I wont buy again its not a miracle product but good quality i bought this product almost one month ago and i have been use in since thenmorning and evening i dont see any improvement in the skin texturein the clarity and my skin is not more firmMy advice for all of you dont even waste your money in this product is not worththe cost is way too high and you will not see any change Ive been using this product for 4 weeks now both morning and night Literally nothing has changed Its basically a very expensive bottle of tea that you rub on your faceand doesnt make any difference Lol I spend a fair amount on products for my face so Im usually okay with a higher price tag as long as the product delivers Unfortunately this is not one of those items The only positive thing I have to say is at least it didnt make me break out So there is that Overall I dont recommend this product and will not repurchase\\nread more Sorry but this product really isnt for me The first time I used it its overly sticky has an odd smell and broke me out like crazy without even seeing any difference in my skin Only reason I give it 45 is because of the price and I still cringe deep down inside when I go to buy a new bottle paying 200 CAD HOWEVER I cant stop This stuff is amazing and I notice results instantly after use The effects on my skin were plumpness hydration radiance and smoothing of wrinkles I also have very sensitive skin but this essence is so gentle I have never had a bad reaction It feels calming and soothing Its crazy expensive but it works\\nread more This product is not worth the price While I did see results and my skin looked firmer I had better luck with Paulas Choice AHA liquid exfoliant Also the first time I used it it gave me little red bumps all over my forehead My skin is sensitive but I have never had issues with Amore Pacific until this product I will finish using the bottle but will not purchase again After beginning to use the brand in March 2019 I splurged on this with a few more Amore Pacific Items in May 2019 I am not blown away but then Im not an essence expert I admit I bought into the hype of using an essence I dont notice any other major changes to my skin except for the fact that I need less moisturizer  the same as with any other essence Ill keep it because it doesnt upset my sensitive skin You know that slightly damp and clean feeling you get after youve used a good toner You wont get that feeling with this one I felt like I was rubbing my cotton pad over my face Im glad I got a few of these as samples and that I didnt invest my money in this Not sure how it made it to the Allure list This is thicker and more moisturizing than I was expecting It is pretty basic and works well even for my winter skin It is nothing spectacular for the price though and I dont think I will repurchase I received this in a boxycharm box and was super excited to try it I am a K Beauty Fanatic I travel all over the world for skincare and I was really excited to try it However it was disappointing I used this on a few occasions with different application methods I always start with small amounts at first as most kbeauty brands have a less is more application method wasnt impressed I tried adding bigger dollops on my face no larger than a dime I felt even stickier than before Then I tried my quartz roller with about the same amount as last time After that I tried applying with my finger tips again but patted it outwards on my face No matter what I tried it always made my face feel sticky and that it just sat on top of my skin I didnt even feel that my face was moisturized It gave the appearance of dewy moisturized skin but my face actually felt dryer after each use and my skin texture went down hill I will say that it did not clog my pores though Overall I would highly recommend a sample before trying it for yourself I wont be recommending it to anyone and youre better off with another K Beauty brand\\nread more Very lightweight and felt good on my skin I do appreciate this didnt break me out or aggravate my sensitive face Unfortunately it wasnt moisturizing enough for me during the dry winter months I will definitely purchase and try again during the warmer months though I was really hoping for this moisturizer to do the trick for me and it didnt I have very dry skin and I was told that this would be perfect for me however it was just very sticky It has no smell which is good It feels kind of hydrating but none of it matters because its so freaking sticky and doesnt even absorb into the skin Its so bad I washed my face again to get it off I felt disgusting clogged and slimy Not worth it Idk where the 5 star reviews are from honestly This was a super basic moisturizer I used it when I didnt need so much during the day in summer but I couldnt really tell any differences when using it Didnt like the tacky feel left even after it absorbed into the skin So it is sticky but it goes away after a few minutes and its dry I personally have been using it more so on my dry hands and it makes them sooooo soffttt I havent even used it yet and I know I wont like it It smells like glue Ive since read reviews and I wouldnt buy this product Too much plastic packaging Smells odd and isnt super moisturizing Maybe better in summer I really wanted to love this but its so sticky as many others have said and just doesnt feel good Like my skin doesnt feel refreshed or moisturized I gave 2 stars for the ingredients and the packaging Wanted to love this but it hasnt done anything good for my skin Feels yucky The first week of using this cream was great second week I started to break out with cystic acne and that basically continued until I switched face creams I have oily sensitive skin just for reference This is such a weird moisturizer Left my skin super sticky and after about 5 mins of it on my face got super red and hot so I rinsed it off and applied my regular moisturizer Wanted to love this but its not for me I got this as a deluxe sample and tried it because I ran out of my original moisturizer This stuff is so thick and sticky and within 2 minutes of it being on my face my skin was bright red and burning and it happened every time I used it Didnt like this at all Very creamy but settled in wrinkles and made my eyes look worse not better Great product I have really dark undereye circles that are just genetically there no matter what I do This product is the best that Ive ever tried for covering up the dark circles It applies easily and doesnt dry out the area Ive been buying it for years and continue to go back to it This used to be my go to product for under eyes its has a great creamy consistency that doesnt dry out the delicate eye skin but there is such little product in this pan that its not worth the price There are also much better formulas like the Kevyn Aucoin sensual skin enhancer that again has that natural radiant finish but with wayyyyy more product Super drying I cannot use it because I am a mature woman and it just dries out my undereye area so much I would rather use nothing than use this product Product is difficult to apply It covers but is too heavy In addition it creases Love this I do not wear foundation usually just a little concealer but I have been replacing my concealer with this as its a little lighter weight and its a game changer I have freckles that I love and this product does not hide them it just evens the skin tone out enough to look awake It is super lightweight so this will not cover the redness of a pimple but I use in just under my eyes and its perfect If you prefer the natural look you will not be disappointed I gave it 4 stars because it does tend to crease a bit as it is like a concealer consistencey and I have to mix two shades to get my perfect color right now wish they had more than three shades\\nread more Does the job Love it because there is no extra shine or sunscreen smell Applies easy This sunscreen is very lightweight If you apply a lot on the face then it smells It smells chemically It is definitely the most lightweight sunscreen Ive ever used I highly recommend if you can withstand the smell haha I like the consistency Not oily and thin and a little bit goes a long way However it has that sunscreen metallic smell which i hate you cant smell it when you first put it on but probably after about 20 minutes you can definitely smell it which makes me feel like my skin is dirty even if it isnt if it didnt have that smell i would give it five stars Really like it Saved me from the city sun and from the tropics too The only downside is that it can make your face a bit too white I really wanted to like this sunscreen as I read an article on Bazaar magazine recommending it for sensitive skin I immediately bought it but unfortunately after just one week using it it broke me out like crazy It gave me tiny bumps on my forehead side of my face and chin It is lightweight but it does leave a shiny film and a little white cast its not complete sheer and matte AT ALL I think it didnt work for me because my skin is very sensitive but if you dont have this problem it might work for you\\nread more Very thin making it easy to apply a thin layer but its still slightly greasy Not what I was looking for but not a bad product A higher spf than others which is nice but still has to be reapplied ever to hours so not really a point of putting it under foundation Liquid consistency still left my skin feeling tightdry even with moisturizer underneath So lightweight I got burned yes I am a brown skin girl Not good if you are already struggling with hyperpigmentation This SPF moisturizer is very thick and heavy and has an unpleasant odor Not for combination or oily skin As others have said I desperately wanted to love this product but it made me break out like never before I enjoyed the heavier texture and the moisturization it gave my skin Unlike other moisturizers it did not seem to pill when I put on makeup and I genuinely enjoyed using it until my face broke out Ive given it almost a week and my skin is only getting worse I have very clear skin I usually only get a few hormonal blemishes but this made my forehead and sides of face break out like crazy It stared as raised bumps and has progressively turned into white heads I also noticed my face is incredibly itchy I am very disappointed and will have to return\\nread more I was scared of having an oily face ha ha ha but didnt happend I think it will change during summer Not too sure how I feel about this one Ive been using for a few days now Im not sure its actually doing what it claims to do considering that the SPF is meant to lay on top of the skin to create a barrier against the sun while the moisturizer is meant to penetrate the skin This cream is extremely heavy I unfortunately found continued use to make me break out and leave with me with a very oily face Not good for sensitive skin I enjoyed the original so was hoping that this would be just as great while also adding more SPF into my routine The smell gets to be overwhelming once I apply it thankfully it goes away but those first 510 min is intense It slightly burns my eyes which I guess is due to the essential oils Most importantly this does not hydrate my dry skin and it is not cosmetically elegant Applying foundation over this moisturizer leads to a patchy application that clings to the moisturizer and cakes up\\nread more This product was far too oily for me I was having problems with dry skin and I saw so many MUAs on YouTube swearing by it but it made me so greasy Even when I used a very small amount Would not use again And its far too expensive if you ask me Its super hydrating and does not feel like youre putting on sunscreen It does have the sunscreen smell but its not overwhelming at all The only reason I cant give it 5 stars is because it does not work well with makeup I have very dry skin so on days where Im not using any makeup this is a great product However if applying under makeup it tends to rub off during the application process and it gets annoyingly patchy I have only used it under concealer\\nread more Also wanted to like this product I opted for this moisturizer because of the SPF I have a vitamin C serum Im using from Kiehls right now and the SPF moisturizers are suppose to keep you from further dark marks However I have been breaking out constantly and unfortunately I had to take away my cleanser the vitamin C serum and the moisturizer to do the process of elimination to get to the root of my breakouts because all three of these products were new to my regimen I wish I would have gone the opposite way because it was this moisturizer Also wish I would have trailed all three individually because they were new now that was my fault\\nread more I have combination skin and I only ever get oily on my nose chin and sometimes my forehead However this face cream made my face look like there had been an oil spill My cheeks were extremely greasy every time I used it and I ended up returning it I absolutely LOVE the ultra facial cream without spf and was super exited to try the one with spf It is such a hassel to apply sunscreen ontop of moisterizer I do like this product and would recommend But as many others here have pointed out it can make my skin a bit too oily The texture is denser and thicker than their regular cream without spf And I belive the cream made me break out the first two weeks The breakout subsided but its worth to keep it mind if you easily break out So even if my skin is dry this product is perhaps a bit to heavy But probably amazying for really dry skin\\nread more Let me start by saying that the regular non SPF version of this is decent Not super hydrating but not DEHYDRATING This one felt like it was taking moisture OUT of my skin I was using it during summer when my skin is usually more normal and it made it feel so dehydrated and dull I didnt like this one at all Made my face feel really greasy all day It applied onto the face so smoothly and I like the texture of it a lot but sadly my skin just did not like this I could see why and how people liked this product but it didnt work for me I had breakouts and it made my face itch a lot Boo Im in love with the Glow Recipe Sleeping Mask but as it has AHAs I dont want to use it every night When I saw that this product was claiming to be pillow proof I was so excited and eager to try The pillow proof technology in the Glow Recipe Sleeping Mask is absolutely phenomenal so I was expecting something similar with this product That however was not the case This mask stays sticky and comes off on my pillow just like anything else would for the most part The moisturizing properties feel fine however Its just meh\\nread more Is it cooling Yes Does it smell good Absolutely Is it sticky Uh huh I like this product even given that it makes my skin tacky after applying I really enjoy the texture and would repurchase Overall its a good product but it isnt life altering After trying it a handful of times Ive came to find that I cant leave this on my face overnight I end up breaking out in these TINY little white heads Like teeny little water balloons sorry for the visual BUT I can leave it on for about an hour or so with some hydrating benefits and no side effects Okay so I just got this a few days or so ago and recently started incorporating it into my nighttime routine  because its winter but I also still sleep with a fan so I tend to get more dried out Anyway I really wanted to give it 5 stars but Im torn between 3 As I implemented this into my skincare routine and used a couple times a week I started noticing a lot of clogged pores that formed on my forehead Im really wanted to like this product because it is a really great consistency and very hydrating but just clogged too many of my pores that left my forehead looking bumpy Sadly will be returning  The first time I tried it I woke up with eight new zits on my face Returned it the next day Im pretty certain after isolating products that this is the one that is breaking me out I have fairly unproblematic sometimes dryer skin It breaks out normally only around my period Since using this I have been experiencing consistent breakouts I will not buy again but I might experiment with it more Additionally I feel that it left my skin looking somewhat sickish like the pale sweatier looking face that one might associate with a cold This never happened to me before using this product\\nread more This sleeping mask will not transfer to your pillow case it stays on your face nicely throughout the night When I wake up in the morning I find my skin moisturizer not exactly dewy but definitely not dry or right There is no weird smell its cooling to put on summer nights but winter nights can be less pleasant cuz the gel cream is cold to touch Sticky not as good as glow recipe it smells nice though Maybe I added good much so dont add too much My skin is the type to agree with mostly anything that is labels hydrating or moisturizing My skin did not agree with this product at all This enlarged my pores caused irritation and created small zit like bumps that had me itchy all night I put up with this mask twice before I gave up I really tried to like this I absolutely love this brand The black tea is amazing for antiaging and for antioxidants which is so important for our skin It went on so nicely and left my skin feeling so soft This feels great on the skin but I have not seen any results I tried this in the store and it felt great Then I got it home and used it for a week Other reviewers said it made their face feel greasy and I couldnt figure out why Then the stuff just started to sit on top of my skin and it felt grossly greasy It barely soaked into my skin and I have dry skin The one point the Sephora team member made was that this isnt a waterbased moisturizer so thats the main reason I think it wouldnt absorb Also as others have noted the smell of it isnt so great I took it back and exchanged it for another moisturizer\\nread more This cream really delivers on its promise of age defying Visibly blurs lines and makes skin glow My skin looked great in the morning and a little goes along way Ive been using this for several years now and it is great for dry skin Before I started using this I had a lot of dry flaky skin especially on my forehead This keeps my skin moisturized all day The price is a bit high but lasts me a long time I cant say if it really prevents lines or wrinkles Love Ive been using this stuff for many years and I love it I use creams at night more than the day though So I lean towards the black tea corset cream over this one If this came in a larger container Id probably buy it more often A little goes a long way Skin feels wonderful and fine lines decrease but it smells like pickles and was a little heavy for my skin It reminds me of a night cream in consistency but I loved the line reduction on my forehead I wasnt a huge fan of this face cream I didnt like the smell of the cream and I didnt notice any change in my skin Unfortunately this cream didnt work for me I love the scent However I have only had it a short time so I cant be sure how it is working Wish it had SPF I had to return this product It was so greasy on my skin I looked so shiny after applying it It surprises me to read reviews saying it is nongreasy It did not absorb into my skin nicely I started using this after I got it for a birthday present I love Fresh products but this one didnt cut it for me I have combination skin with an oily TZone and even during dry winter this cream will leave a shiny TZone within minutes after application I dont go overboard with my moisturizers if anything I use it too sparingly With this I cant even put BB cream or powder on due to the oiliness If you are going for hydration this will work well It is pricey but a little bit goes a long way it also smells good without being overpowering and packaging is well made\\nread more Im not a fan  I prefer a balm but I decided to try this out as I read reviews stating it was light and indeed it is  but it doesnt melt off all your makeup  Also it broke me out and caused me irritation  So now I just use it for my eyes  I wont purchase again  the packaging is nice thats about it  This is the most poorly designed packaging for this before I even had the opportunity to use this product it spilled all over the contents of my suitcase I hadnt even twisted the lid to the open side Over half of the bottle is gone I cannot even try to return it because it spilled on the receipt and its now unreadable Im disappointed I will not be purchasing this again Ill find a new makeup remover It triggered all my acne after i used it and it gives me little bumps on my eyebrows So far so good I only use this at nights with my moisturizing cleanser I hope it continues to do well Purchased this product to use as part of a double cleansing regimen After about 1 week I broke out all over my cheeks I dont tend to have terribly acne prone skin Will not be using again This a decent cleansing oil Really gets the makeup off and when followed by my daily face wash my face feels just like a babys bottom Thank you for this Clinique I wear a full face of makeup up Wunder Brow gel water proof mascara gel liner and at times a bold lip This did nothing but make a mess and take off a small amount of my make up I had to use my cleanser twice I am switching right back to Kiehls Midnight Recovery That product is like a dream come true Im now on my second bottle of this cleansing oil and the quality for the price is quite high There arent any acne triggers for me which is rare in oil cleansers The consistency of it is very thin as opposed to my other fave Boscias Makeup Breakup which is a little thicker but two pumps of this works very well to get makeup and sunscreen off at the end of the day Id give it five stars except when I received the latest bottle about a tenth of the product had leaked during transit and soaked through the packing paper and even half of the shipping boxin spite of the pump being in the locked position Be careful if you plan on traveling with it\\nread more I had high hopes for this cleanser based on the hype To be honest its no better than my Hada Labo oil cleanser and thats half the price and refillable Its not bad but I wont be repurchasing Did not like this product It felt weird on my face and didnt do a good job removing my makeup Im not a fan  I prefer a balm but I decided to try this out as I read reviews stating it was light and indeed it is

thats half the price and refillable Its not bad but I wont be repurchasing Did not like this product It felt weird on my face and didnt do a good job removing my makeup Not for me Too light Made my skin feel a bit chalky Will be returning it I do like the one pump product distribution This is honestly a good moisturizer It did not cause me to break out any I used it with the entire Kate Somerville lineface wash serum then moisturizer not including the olehenriksen toner It did not leave me feeling oily or greasy The only reason for 4 stars is no smell and the cost It is great but not worth the price I think its an okay product I thought I liked it until I started using a moisturizer from DE I think for the price you can do a lot better Its a mediocre moisturizer I dont think Id recommend it Standard moisturizer and its a bit pricey so I knocked off one store I havent broken out from this lotion so I say give it a go Tried and tried to find a moisturizer without glycerin Almost impossible Until this one A keeper I definitely dont see any improvements to my skin but it does its job as a moisturizer I wont be able to use this through summer since Im a combo gal Ive found that after a little humidity andor a hint of sweat Im an oil slick with this despite it being oil free Soa decent winter one for me Love the packaging was using this for acne did not help and its pretty expensive If you have sensitive skin and want a moisturizer that is a safe bet  this is for you This moisturizer soothes your skin as it goes on It does not sting irritate or make my skin any redder than it already is I feel good putting it on due to the ingredients I will always come back to this staple even if it doesnt fulfill all of my needs Its safe and does what its supposed to do without breaking me out or causing irritation At this point thats all I can ask for \\nread more I have dry AND oily skin This did not work for me If you have oily skin but not really dry its best This wasnt for me but I think overall its good I got a free sample of this expecting to love it but was surprisingly disappointed It has a filmlike slime feel to it and not necessarily a bad smell but not a fresh smell either I honestly couldnt get past the initial impression in order to see if it would really help my super oily skin Overall I was very underwhelmed and cant say Id recommend given all the better options out there love the moisture and refreshing qualities but I think its overpriced I have mature skin thats pretty normal so I cant imagine what this would look like on oily skin I felt like it sat on top of my skin when I spritzed it almost FILMY  TACKY Not a clean refreshing feeling at all so I will be returning it This is a nice light mist its better than some facial sprays due to the fact it mists super lightly rather than being a heavy direct spray The only complaint i have about it is the fragrance is very strong but other than that this is a great spray It sounded like a good idea when I ordered it It smells nice it really is not hydrating There are tons of others that actually do what it says I am not a huge fan of this brand anyways I should have known better Its ok I see zero difference but its only been a month and a half so I will continue to use it I cannot stand this moisturizer I read review upon review for many moisturizers before finally choosing this one and after about 2 weeks Im finally going to return it I initially used this with the YTTP exfoliating toner and experienced pilling thought maybe it was that they didnt pair well together I tried it without that toner same thing Thick rolled up chunks of moisturizer balling up on my skin whether or not Im wearing makeup or other skincare products On top of that I dont feel like this is hydrating my combination dry skin at all Finally giving up after so many chances\\nread more I was so excited to try this reading the reviews It caused more dryness and red patches o n my cheeks So disappointed Belif aqua bomb was the first product I have tried in this line Amazing light and great if you have allergies I read about belif Peat miracle revital cream and gave it a try I was not disappointed You can see a difference in your skin within 2 weeks I will repurchase this product I didnt love this eye cream I didnt notice any difference using this moisturizer for 10 months It wasnt any more or less moisturizing than a drugstore eye cream Because of the high price I dont recommend when you could pick up something else I have very dry acne prone skin I always have trouble finding a product that is moisturizing but that will not dry me out I selected this product because it had such great reviews The consistency of the cream was nice and thick However it seemed to be a little bit too thick for me I broke out along my jaw line after using this a couple of days Not a serious break out but enough to realize that something was not agreeing with my skin I returned this and picked up the Belif Aquabomb which is lighter in consistency\\nread more Good product but too expensive for the amount of product Not good for summer greasy I received a sample and while it was great paired under foundation or tinted moisturizer it did leave a ashy cast Its okay I have always thought that each skin is different and for some people or types skins might work and other one might not For my own experience after almost 3 moths of use not the result was not what I expected I recently tried this brand out Im usually a fan of Peter Thomas but I wanted to give it a try to another brand I havent seen any big results or or the disappearance of some wrinkle even using my GLOPRO twice a week I bought all the set night and day including Serum of the Vitamin C Ester but really the result has not been much The truth nothing  I feel that the glow I was looking for it was better with the Peter Thomas line set for the Vitamin C collection\\nread more very disappointed it was mostly air maybe Ill get about two weeks worth This product is absolutely amazing I always feel i can skip bb or cc cream after applying this product I really enjoy the texture of the cream and since I am a little dry I like the glow it leaves as well One of the few sunscreen moisturizers that uses mineral SPF However I am switching products because I dont like the pot packaging Its not very sanitary and its difficult to control how much Im using If they switched to pump I would definitely repurchase But if you have sensitive skin and want something very nourishing try this\\nread more Definitely enjoy this I needed anmorr moisturizing cream for the winter months because the OH truth face cream wasnt preventing dryness anymore This has Vitamin C Ester so it kept up with my Vitamin C needs has an SPF and is NOT greasy and continues to fight fine lines and wrinkles Very lovely texture and absorbs fast I would not repurchase simply because it didnt really help much with anything At the same time it did not cause any issues which is a HUGE plus for me since everything destroys my skin I dont use it daily only after aggressive clay masks or scrubbing It is definitely worth a try at least once While I have had better facial oils I dont really have anything to complain about other than the price For 95 I expect miracles and to be honest it didnt outperform any of the other favorite oils Clinique and Drink Elephant Did this product give radiance to my skin  yes but what face oil doesnt I will say this could be useful for applying underneath makeup but for my new natural routine I personally believe its not worth the hype\\nread more First i will start with what I like about this oil The smell is heavenly The consistency is smooth and does not leave a heavy feeling or oil slick on my face What I do not like The price tag is rather inflated The gold flecks are for looks only they are not small enough to be distributed onto the face for any kind of extra glow affect And my biggest complaint for a 95 product i did not expect the lid to breakcome apart 4 days into using the product or at all for that matter I keep my products stored in a temperature controlled environment and am nothing if not gentle with every product I have invested my hard earned money in So I thought that was pretty pathetic for such a high end company and high price tag product I had to put my oil in my own bottle to continue to using All in all the oil itself is indeed very nice i have yet to notice any actual difference in my skin compared to using an oil half the price So i will not be repurchasing this particular product again\\nread more the packaging  details of this is sooooo beautiful the product itself i found kind of useless it felt like an oil  just an oil it didnt stay on my skin i feel like it would just melt off my face  not sink in the price is ridiculous as well for just an oil i didnt find my skin feeling hydrated which is weird because i have dry skin i didnt see any difference in my complexion i just tried using 100 organic shea butter  coconut oil  that does so much more than this ever did i was so disappointed with this one\\nread more I really tried to like this product as Its recommended in so many magazines and by Sephora employees It made my skin break out and have clogged pores I dont have oily skin tends to be drier actually but this didnt make my skin feel moisturized just felt oily and looked oily for a while I like the Drunk Elephant Whipped Cream better for moisturizing my skin I LOVE THIS OIL I use it night and day and it has not clogged my pores It is perfectly hydrating and gentle Sometimes in the winter I have even dabbed some of the oil onto my eyelids I also use it on my neck I love the vinoperfect serum but this one broke me out Returned for the Herbivore emerald oil and love it The fragrance isnt my favorite in the line but it does leave my skin feeling refreshed Its lightweight and absorbs quickly so I dont have to wait long before my head can hit the pillow I just dont know how I feel about this product on one hand it feels super luxurious and smells superb but it is just a little bit too greasy for me I feel like I break out every time I try to use it consecutively I am going to continue to try to use it until the bottle is gone I really wanted to love this product because First Aid Beauty does wonders for me However it broke me out literally all over my face  It made my skin glow which was a nice plus but whats the point of the glow if you have acne everywhere In general I thought this face cream was ok but I wouldnt purchase it again I was looking for a moisturizing cream with SPF to wear under my foundation and this works ok but its definitely pretty oily It did protect my skin from sun damage which I appreciated I live in Seattle so I really only needed this in the summer I think because its kind of thick and leaves my face feeling greasy it wasnt the best to wear under foundation So if you dont really wear makeup this might be ok but itll make your face kind of shiny\\nread more For the first time ever I am actually allergic to this product I bought it cause I thought it could do the job and it for sure did Sun protected and a week long of itching Please get the sample first before you buy this I am for sure returning this This product is extremely greasy Once applied my face looked shiny and it felt so heavy on my skin My face even broke out from using the cream I have normal skin not too dry and not sensitive I have never had an issue with any other face creams Very disappointing I love all the First Aid Beauty products but this was my least favorite Kind of greasy and felt like it never really absorbed Plus as the day progressed it migrated into my eyes and caused my eyes to water I love several other products from the First Aid Beauty brand but this one just isnt seeming to do it for me The price is great but my biggest complains have to do with 1 the smell and 2 the texture It smells like bananas to me I like to eat bananas and sometimes the smell is nice but this smell just really bothers me Especially because I continue to smell it on my face Im also not crazy about the texture Its extremely oily I have drycombination skin and have to use lots of powder over this moisturizer to decrease shine\\nread more I bought this product to use as my daily moisturizer in the morning I have combination skin a very oily tzone and dry cheeks I do NOT wear foundation during the week A little bit goes a long way with this product It goes on very thick and makes my skin look super greasy at first probably because of the SPF but Ive found that after about 1520 minutes it absorbs a bit and does not feel as heavy or oily Because my cheeks are dry I usually start my application there and then work it through to the rest of my face I actually feel like this moisturizer makes my skin less oily than most daily moisturizers Ive tried with NO SPF Im pushing 30 so SPF is important to me at this point I did wear this under a full face of makeup this weekend and did not feel that it contributed to any accelerated or additional creasing etc Allinall its a good daily moisturizer but again  dont overdo it especially if you do have oily skin\\nread more I have very fair oily skin that is prone to redness and was hoping this would cut down on my need for foundation While it did an okay job of evening out my skin tone it feels so heavy and greasy on my skin I cant stand it Returned I do really like the richness of this cream but am not into the scent This face cream feels great on and is more lightweight than any moisturizer with spf Ive tried before On the downside it gets slippery when its hot outside and it smells a little dowdy I love almost everything Kate Somerville makes and am a huge fan this however was a miss for me The product goes on nicely and has a very subtle smell which is a plus The downside for me was that I found anything I put on top of it no matter how long it dried would pill up If you are just wearing moisturizer its fine though The other issue for me was that my skin would get slightly red and feel a little tingly in a not so great way Her other goat milk products work so well for me and I love them but for some reason this one just wasnt as great\\nread more This is a light moisturizer It absorbs into the skin not fairly quickly for a light moisturizer but I would say 2025 minutes The skin feels smooth and nice after application The only thing that bothers me is the smell which is a bit overwhelming and it is still smellable on the skin at least until the cream is absorbed It is hydrating and leaves the skin feeling smooth and not oily Only a small amount needed for the entire face Wouldnt recommend as a moisturizer for a cold winter as face can feel a bit dry after being in the cold for a bit I would use it as a light hydrating cream in an okay weather\\nread more Im sad to only give this product 3 stars I actually like the moisturizer fine Its lightweight and leaves my skin refreshed Unfortunately I hate the packaging of this product The consistency of this moisturizer is liquid  not a cream Every time I go to open the container I lose a bunch of the product because it just splashes over the side Maybe Im the only one having this issue but its happened to me on several occasions Each time it causes a mess and then I get frustrated because it feels like Im wasting my moisturizer With the liquid consistency of this product I truly feel like it should be sold in a container that pumps or pours out so that you dont have this issue\\nread more Perks hygienic dispenser and you get every last drop Cons the smell and didnt like it underneath makeup This is the first time I have used any Kate Sommerville product and I have mixed feelings The moisturizer does sink into my clean quickly not trace left moisturizing and has started to reduce redness in my checks BUT I just hate putting this one the texture just feels so wrong Its like soup too liquidy and quite frankly I just dont look forward to using this in the morning which is a same as otherwise it preforms well At the end of the day the texture will prevent me from rebuying this\\nread more I got this in my FabFitFun box and absolutely love it so far I have fair skin that has a lot of redness plus I live in a colder climate so it is usually dry This has reduced my redness and and I believe my hormonal acne that I struggle with as an adult Ive only used it a few times but so far so good I will say to me it has the slightest funny smell that is just different so if youre sensitive it could bother you\\nread more I like that this is a light moisturizing and doesnt feel like its clogging my pores but I dont actually find it very moisturizing Maybe it would be good for the summer but it doesnt cut it for winter This is the worst packaging Ive ever come across I got this in a FabFitFun box and I will never ever be purchasing the real thing The cream itself is super thin and runny and every time you close the lid a ton of it blurps out everywhere Not to mention my face still feels dry after using it I would not recommend this product especially for this price Helped with redness and moisturized my skin pretty well It has a light consistency which I like because I can put this on before applying makeup without that sticky consistency look My last bottle seemed to run shortI was disappointed with how little it gave given the price I have acne prone skin that I treated which made my skin dry outThis product was recommended as ance fighting AND moisturizing I had high hopes but it made me breakout even more than before Looks like they reformulated and added a bunch of chemicals Its alright Its really hydrating But the skin doesnt soak it up quickly This is very moisturizing without being too thick and perfect to wear under your makeup It sinks into my skin quickly and gives me a nice dewy finish Im very disappointed in the packaging though because when the pump stops working and you unscrew the lid to get more its this tiny little container the outer packaging tricks you into thinking you will get a lot more and seems like a waste of plastic Other than that I like the way it dispenses product and the product itself\\nread more Not bad but its not a product I would buy again Its a bit stick and does not soak into my skin and leave it feeling hydrated rather it seems to sit on top of my skin Not really a fan of the way it dispenses either not sure Im going to know when the container is close to empty Its make my skin so dry I had to return it Its not freeze time at all This cream doesnt feel heavy on the skin its recommended to use it once a week but I use it twice a week I use it in my face and in my neck and every morning after using it I can feel my skin so much smoother and tighter I havent seen a dramatically change because I have been using this for less than a month but I have high hopes for it I have been using this product for a little bit more than 3 months now and I love it Know that I only write reviews for products that are worth it and I have actually tried for more than three months My skin is combination I have tried more expensive night creams than this and this is still my favorite It is an underrated product but nonetheless amazing the consistency is soooo cushiony You can literally poke the cream all way through the bottom of jar with your finger and the next day the dent in cream will be gone and completely filled with the cream This is how it feels on the skin as well It makes your skin super plump and it absorbs so fast super hydrating nonirritating I have seen some improvement of lines on forehead I think with continue used skin will continue to improve Again I have used this for a little bit over 3months and Im still 34 of a jar left you only need very little\\nread more Feels nice on the skin and relaxing Love that I can fall asleep with it on and not having to wake up to wash my face But I think its meant for younger skin I havent finished the bottle but I dont think I will be buying again after I finish If you have younger skin I would recommend it but not for 50  Dudnt see much difference Have been using this product for three months and have seen zero results i actually find when i wake up in the morning it makes my skin look worse like all my wrinkles are squished together Not worth the 50 I find my 15 anti wrinkle olay night mask gives me better results Will not be repurchasing Ive added this to my routine and my skins finally not flaking while at work I work in a hospital and the air is extremely dry That along with the cold winter months in Chicago my face is flaky and tight and thats with applying essence moisturizer and a face oil Im finally not flaking while working 12 hr shifts This will be a major player in my Kbeauty Skin care regimen Really wanted this to hit it out of the park for me but I havent noticed a difference in terms of antiaging or plumping My skin is noticeably softer but thats not what my main desire was when I purchased this Giving it one more try tonight and if I still am underwhelmed its going back I am 38 with fair combination skin I have many Laneige products and I do like this mask but I think the original sleeping mask is much better The texture of this one is a bit thicker but I dont see a huge difference between to two This moisturizer is just ok If you have dry skin it wont be enough especially in winter I have combo skin and its not hydrating enough for winter The plus side is that its fragrance free and doesnt leave a film on the skin This moisturizer is a little bit on the oilier side I think its great for winter season but I wouldnt use it any other season There are definitely better moisturizers This product gave me a pimple on my chin and another pimple on my forehead It never absorbed in my skin left an extremely noticeable sheen on my face the entire time I cannot recommend this product at all I will go ahead and use it on my feet and chest area Lastly it smells very bad I love the amount of product that this comes in I dont feel like it does anything special but it is nice when you use other products that have active ingredients Doesnt my my combo skin super oily I definitely think this would be a great moisturizer for winter time Definitely feels nice and doesnt have really any smell I have super dry skin  washing with water makes my skin feel tight I was excited to try an ultra moisturizer but this just feels STICKY on top of my skin It doesnt feel like my skin is absorbing any of it Definitely great for a dry face Its very creamy it feels like a body cream for your face It is truly ultra My face is shiny every day that I use this moisturizer Ive really scaled back on the amount that I apply I guess I keep using it bc I dont want to waste money but this formula is not for me especially not during the summer when I truly have combination skin Every time I used this product it irritated  burned my eyes When I applied the moisturizer I kept it as far as possible from my eyes  this would still happen I am very disappointed because I always heard many good things about this product Not the right fit I guess Was not a fan of this moisturizer it did not mesh well with my skincare routine at the time and contributed to extra oil on my skin and horrible acne I havent experienced in years from a product Returned this ASAP Its okay for a clean product but I find it doesnt remove all of my mascara without using a lot of product Over all its not my favourite makeup remover for the eye area Pro it doesnt leave too much of a greasy residue Not made for eyes it remove makeup but this product is too oily for eyes My eyes were still red the morning after The first night I used this I woke the next day and had 6 huge clogged pores on my forehead My main struggle is clogged pores on my forehead and skin texture and this product irritated my skin and further worsened my skin Before this product my skin texture was finally starting to smooth out and I had zero clogged pores This product is also very thick and you need like 6 pumps for it to even barely remove your makeup Very disappointed\\nread more This was a really great cleansing oil The smell to me was a slight almond scent and it was light enough that it didnt bother my sensitive skinnose The oil had a thicker consistency than I was used to so that is why I had to knock off a star I felt that I had to use more pressure and im trying to prevent premature aging on my skin to work the product in to break down my makeup It did an excellent job at breaking down my makeup and sunscreen and it emulsified well with water I did feel like there was a slight residue afterwards but I do a double cleanse so it did not bother me too much The packaging is cute but it would have been nicer if the bottle was not opaque so you could see exactly when you were going to run out The price was pretty decent for the amount you received This product lasted me about 23 months with daily use Overall I DEFINITELY recommend this If youre looking for a cleansing oil that works on sensitive skin you should give this a shot\\nread more love this as a part of a 2 step cleanse Its thick and is very comforting it will remove makeup as long as you use it properly and start dry and really massage into skin then work into lather with warm water Took off a star becuase i dont love the scent of almond oil but works well and oils didnt break me out I love this because its very hydrating It terms of taking off make up it does a fine job But I mainly use it as a second cleanser to hydrate my dry skin i like this it does a great job of cleansing my skin and feels nice when i rub it in really does melt makeup although i dont wear makeup that often the only thing is that i almost wish the oil was thicker and that when it emulsified it was milkier but thats just kind of a personal texture preference i only give 5 stars to products that WOW me so 4 stars Its okay for a clean product but I find

my skin from the sun while also giving it an antiaging boost Often this means slapping a bunch of chemicals on my skin but not with this Origins option Love it and it keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day long  even in a cold Canadian winter day I have dry skin This cream is not good for winter I have been using this cream for more than 2 weeks havent notice any difference on wrinkles yet I like this product because its a moisturizer with spf I apply it each morning before I head out the door It is a bit pricey but worth it I have been using it for about a month and so far its good It is a heavier cream for me but I believe its because of the SPF My night cream is definitely lighter I have combination skin of dry and oily But for me it doesnt have that oily feel I just wish it had some fragrance to it but it doesnt A little bit for goes a long way when applying it to my face and neck\\nread more Amazing daily moisturizer I have combination skin and this does wonders The price is steep but its well worth it I had a moisturizer I was very happy with but switched to this because I need an spf and I hate applying sunscreen separately My skin has dried up since switching Im so disappointed I have dry spots on my tzone and beside my nose My skin was glowing and looked amazing before I started using this thanks to my previous moisturizer I am going to finish the jar and see if its just my skin getting used to the new routine but unless something miraculous happens I will not repurchase and I will not recommend this to anyone\\nread more Love how this cream absorbs into my skin and while it is heavier than other creams I have used it doesnt feel heavy once it has absorbed It is great for the winter but I will have to see how it does in the heat of the summer before I determine that it is my new favorite I have combination skin and this makes my skin look extremely greasy after an hour Origins is such a great clean beauty company I was looking for a daily moisturizer with SPF but none really appealed to me for various reasons Then I found this It hydrates REALLY well absorbs quickly and does an excellent job of protecting my skin from UV rays bolstered by Maeloves The Glow Maker serum It doesnt feel heavy or greasy and it layers well over other products The only thing Im not in love with is the scent but it fades once the moisturizer is fully absorbed so no big\\nread more Kind of greasy and made me breakout every time I used it I like this brand but not this product I have very sensitive skin which is dry all year round I use a combination of 3 moisturizers every morning and then my sunscreen and primer I started I using this in the morning after my shower and my skin feels so much better I can cut down on the number of products not eliminate I use Not sure about th antiaging part though I dont know why this has so many good reviews it didnt feel hydrating  maybe if you have oily skin it will work okay but its super light it sinks in your skin and feels like you put nothing on Ive been using this for a couple of months now I dont really see the effect of it but the scent is very refreshing I just cant figure out why this product has so many good reviews Ive never used a serum that dried my skin more than this one Dont waste your money Feels like putting water on your skin except water is free I dont know why this has so many good reviews it didnt feel hydrating  maybe if you have oily skin it will work okay but its super light it sinks in your skin and feels like you put nothing on Ive been using this for

more than this one Dont waste your money Feels like putting water on your skin except water is free My skin was feeling dry even though I was using a highly rated moisturizer I ordered this and it did the trick I will buy it again Rich but not too thick No overwhelming scent to set off my allergies Ive tried at least ten moisturizers within the same price range from Shiseido as well as other brands This one seemed to slightly outperform the other ones in terms of moisture texture absorbant capacity and the effect on the texture of the skin Its not rolling off the skin and is thick enough yet not heavy The smell is a bit too strong  bit like old perfume which I assume could irritate the sensitive skin Its antiaging properties are still not visible to me even after a week of nightly and occasionally daily use\\nread more I am still giving this product a chance to perform I have narrowed down my new dryness to the product I have stopped using it on my forehead and only use below the eye level I kept noticing flaking skin in the mornings on my forehead and even some itching Once I quit using on my forehead it cleared up I will have to use more of the product before I can tell for sure if it does all that it says it will do\\nread more Due to the winter cold I noticed for the first time that my skin was beginning to get dry and started to peel around the corners of my nose on my cheeks and on my forehead I normally use Josie Marans face oil but for some odd reason it wasnt working as well as it used to Im Asian and I remember by Aunt using this line when I was younger Im not 40 Her skin was flawless so when I noticed Sephora carried it I decided to give it a try I originally purchased the NutriPerfect Day Cream with Sunscreen and fell in love with itso I bought the NIght Cream a week later I am in deep love with this product While on the pricey side I can notice a HUGE difference in my skin It is not so heavy that it clogs your pores I am VERY sensitive to breaking out but it does provide plenty of hydration while you sleep I only rated the product 4 stars because of the price Other than that its a great product\\nread more I used to use Shiseido products and never minded their strong scents But not any more Not only this cream has very strong scent but also it isnt rich enough to moisturize my very very dry skin I returned it This gives your face a nice healthy glow when you wake up in the morning and all day It does a great job moisturizing and sinks in well I also use Shiseidos Benefience eye cream and that too does an amazing job I wouldnt mind a bit less scent in the night cream but Im not a huge fan of overly scented products others will probably love the scent Bought this to give my skin some extra moisture It sunk in after a few minutes and didnt look too greasy but unfortunately gave me tiny bumps all over my face I purchased this and so far it is hydrating also works well during the winter I noticed it kee8my foundation from sticking to dry spots I would purchase again I bought a full size bottle of this after I received a free sample and liked it because it was moisturizing It goes on greasy though I then found a cheaper alternative at a natural grocery store so I think this is overpriced for what you can buy at the natural food grocery store It worked fine and didnt cause me to break out but Ive since moved on to other products I would not buy this again because there are more affordable aragan oils available The dropper applicator was a pain it would have been better in a spray bottle\\nread more I used to LOVE this product it was just enough oompf for my oily skin Sephora was good enough to replace a bottle a received when it did not have an applicator However the new bottle has some sort of residue or bacteria in it The product is cloudy and it sinks like a sediment I found it actually irritated my skin which leads me to believe it was a previously used or opened product or contamination occurred at the facility I am off this for a while now as it has happened twice\\nread more This is a very hydrating oil but I would only recommend it if you have dry skin that isnt acneprone My combination skin broke out from using this I always try to aim to buy any skincare products that are cruelty free  it is a big benefit Josie Maran in general knocks it out of the park for green beauty 100 natural free of the sketchy stuff recyclable all good things This formula for is perfect for someone with my skin type  super combination  oily dry sensitive  I have a little bit of all of that on my face The texture of this formula is as the label states  LIGHT  and it is perfect for me I also love to use this not just as an oil but also to dilute foundationstinted moisturizers for a more fine lesspigmented layer I also use this product as a cuticle oil A little goes a long way so dont over apply\\nread more I am obsessed with the regular argan oil for some reason this light version made my skin very very oily The original doesnt have that effect on it It may just be how it works against my skin I didnt notice at first until I put this on in the daylight I noticed specks of some substance on the inside of the bottleIm not entirely sure what it could be I have a sample bottle of the regular argan oil and that one does not have any issues Smelled great but it broke my face out really bad Unfortunately Great for oil but sometimes my skin didnt feel as clean Helped keep my acne at bay but didnt do much with new ones forming I love that this product is clean It washes your face well It smells like tea tree so you feel fresh I dont honestly think it does anything in the way of preventing blemishes or reducing current blemishes It does last a long time Ive had it for 5 or so months Lathers well Price is good All in all its ok but I certainly do not think it is the miracle products others have reviewed I like this cleanser I bought the whole kit Cleanser Exfoliator Mask and Toner and I have been using it for a month I felt like this did its job It didnt dry me out but it definitely refined the excess grease on my face The price is a lil steep but if you can splurge go for it I have an oily tzone and Ive been using this just in that area and it has really helped It doesnt strip by skin but it also leaves my skin feeling clean Very cool and refreshing Didnt do anything for me I wouldnt recommend to people who have the same type of skin I do I had high hopes for this cleanser but it made my skin freak out  I got unbelievable texture and several cystic pimples which I had under control I gave this cleanser a few weeks to purge before trashing it Feels nice and refreshing but didnt make a difference in my skin I still broke out I have sensitive acne prone skin around my jaw line and this seemed to aggravate it even more Only used for a week and i know some people say your skin is supposed to break out at first and then clears up but i dont think thats a good thing I was excited about this in hopes that it would get my oil in control however it did not For some reason I felt it made my skin MORE oily I am someone who takes care of my skin and makes sure its not another variable causing the issue It just doesnt work If you have oily skin youre better off going with a mild cleanser without fragrances and irritants Do not use this cleanser if you struggle with fungal acne The second ingredient is sodium cocoyl isethionate which feeds malassezia There are other ingredients in there as well that worsen fungal acne I made the mistake of buying this on a whim without checking the ingredients and I started to breakout again after a couple uses The idea of oil control is cute but this product seems to do more drying than balancing This is probably the last time I buy from Ole Henriksen as the brand doesnt seem to understand the importance of pH and often uses comedogenic ingredients Cute aesthetic tho\\nread more Bought it because its a clean product TBH my hubbie loves it more than me because of the minty smell I still prefer other face cleaning products I have combination skin and was looking for a cleanser that could keep my acne in check while not drying my skin out This cleanser did not help balance my oils but instead made me break out Not for me Im happy with this cleanser I use it daily in the morning to wash my face since it is very gentle It makes my face just slightly dry but I always follow up with moisturizer I use a more powerful cleanser to take off my makeup instead of this product But like I mentioned earlier its gentle enough to use daily This is my second time purchasing this product and will gladly purchase again once I run out The price is very reasonable for the quality\\nread more I love this system of skin care however I have so much trouble with the cap on it Multiple bottles I have bought including my recent purchase is so difficult to open the squirt cap It says to spin the lid clock wise to open and it just simply doesnt work Poor design in my opinion I dislike this product immensely I bought it to help balance my skin after the face wash I was using dried out my skin so bad moisturizing and exfoliating werent enough I Usually love Clinique but not this product I have combo skin and this actually seems to make it oilier after I wash my face So much Ive skipped moisturizing altogether It does not balance nor does it clear my skin if anything I think its breaking me out It definitely leaves my face cloudy and I think it has a fragrance in it thats irritating my face Also with the lid shut it seems to be leaking from the bottle into the lid and actually seemed like its half empty It actually looked half full after 1st couple of uses and I dont use that much when I wash my face for it to look that way Super disappointed  And wont purchase again\\nread more It was extremely drying I have combination to oily skin and this product was not meant for me I like that it lathered but it did not leave my skin feeling clean fresh and nourished It honestly felt like using a soap on my face I like it it was a nice gentle wash Didnt strip my skin Been using the extra mild formula and its the Best cleanser I have used does not dry out my skin Used the mild cleanser before but it would leave me a little tight and dry This one does not If you dont have super dry skin you should stick to the other formulas since this might feel too oily Got a few samples of this to try when I was traveling Worked pretty well Still left a bit of residue but it seemed comparable to DHCs cleansing oil Gets rid of all the makeup really well No breakouts with it and I have acne prone skin The design on this bottle was so poor the cap constantly becomes loose and Ive lost the entire product due to it spilling when I bring it for overnights So so disappointed Not the best This does work but not near as good as others I have tried I will use it up but not repurchase Ive used a whole bottle which is quite a feat I have very sensitive combination and acneprone skin with crater pores and this product cleanses well and leaves my skin feeling slightly plumped and well hydrated I dont wear makeup so I cant speak to how well it works with makeup removal but it does clear pores very respectfully when used with one of those cheap silicone face scrubbies It gets 4 stars only because it doesnt do much else in the way of improving skin It doesnt even out my tone or clear acne or reduce pores but it didnt make anything worse or cause any reactions and for me thats enough for a win I found this to be a great daytoday cleanser and it doesnt interact poorly with any toners or treatments or serums so its been great as an anchor product when Im trying out new items in my regiment Would absolutely recommend if you need something that will consistently work and wont give you any hassle\\nread more I tried this for 30 days and it broke me out SO bad Wish I could give this 0 stars I have tried many cleansers for my sensitive stubbornly dry but then randomly super oily skin with occasional but aggressive breakout fits Finally I have a routine that seems to be working really well for the past year On most days I double cleanse with an oil and then the Kiehls When I dont wear eye make up this is all I use for the face But typically I wear a little concealer under the eyeswhere the pimples du jour are eyeliner and blush Its not a lot of make up but I still love melting it off at the end of the day with an oil Right now Im using the Tata Harper Nourishing Oil Cleanser but was using coconut oil before I rinse that off with water and follow with the Kiehls and it feels like a nice balance Be mindful of how much you use A little goes a LONG way At first I think I was using too much and it started to feel a bit drying Love the gel to foam action Oh it will last you forever I have had the 77 oz bottle for over a year and it just wont quit\\nread more the product is great basically no smell pleasant texture lot of foam however you will not drain the last drop of it since the pump will not let you This product made my skin breakout so badly Especially my cheeks Great scrub Was surprised at how little product there was in the tube Feels nice and minty I liked the smell and the feel of this on my face However it is very difficult to squeeze out of the tube Was it old I bought this scrub before I went on vacation to help get any dirt or impurities out I have oily skin for reference as I was going to a very sandy destination This scrub did its job it removed any sand or dirt from my face and left my face feeling clean but not tight The warming sensation that occurs when you massage the product in is also nice and helps the product emulsify more so it is not so rough on the skin which is a plus I did not use it everyday but the packaging states it can be used everyday Overall Id recommend the product it is a good basic scrub\\nread more Smells lovely I notice my skin is so much smoother and soft This smells like a spalike escape It is very relaxing and enjoyable to use The reason I give it four stars is because it seems to melt into my skin a little too quickly I dont get a long enough chance to massage the granules into my skin before they disappear So its a short polishing window It goes on warm and enjoyably so and then cools and cleanses I had a little texture on my forehead so I decided to do something about it I used the Tatcha the deep cleanse along with this scrub and the Tatcha the water cream and wow The results in the morning were very much desired Definitely recommend to anyone with oilysensitive skin I loved this scrub when I first purchased a year ago but I just made a repurchase and I was a bit saddened The older formula had a nice exfoliating scrub but this new formula has changed I hate when companies put the plastic exfoliating balls in products Although the sandy texture is slightly still there the microbeads are annoying me I took two stars because I hate the beads It clogged my pores on cheeks and chin  I think I will go back to my Clarins lotion with Iris  Im on my 3rd bottle of this which is impressive because of the way I rotate through all kinds of crap I dont need to put on my face For some reason this toner is soothing placating my fussy skin like no other Recently I tried to branch out into 7 skins territory sampling all kinds of eastern and western potions only to come running back to this one head hung down I dont feel like I should have to spend so much on a liquid and will literally cry watching my paycheck sprinkle out onto a cotton pad The essence is fancy water but this is sorcery Acids are so far down the list that I dont expect exfoliation and if I wanted a burn I will grab some P50 This is just normalizing water for my skin which in some regard is pricelessbut dont tell my boyfriend what I just spent on toner both concepts are shocking to him\\nread more I tried to love this I really did but I broke out within two days Its great for skin tone but doesnt get into deep pores and I broke out horribly because of it Back to Murad I go Love SK II but i broke out shortly after using this Not sure why so i discontinued and returned I sooo wanted it to work bc I so believe SK Ii products provide great benefits but something didnt agree with my sensitive skin One less star due to the price but a lovely toner Noticeably clearer and smoother skin after consistent use of this product Does one need to pay 76 for a toner Probably not but after going through several travel bottles that come bundled with the Essence Set im completely sold on this Keeps my skin clear and balanced without drying out my skin and the little extra Pitera is always welcome before I use the Facial Treatment Essence which is probably one my favourite products ever Permanent spot in my regimen This made absolutely no difference for me Maybe it works for others but for the price never again I like the product Makes skin feels nice makes it more smooth and even toned What I dont like is the price and the smell The product has a unique smell almost like vinegar sour smelly feet Its not too potent to make you not use it but definitely caught me by surprise I am not sure if I can see any changes on my face but this toner is very subtle and perfect for my very sensitive skin It does calm my skin I think this toner is very similar to sk11 clearing lotion its too fragrance like the smell when you walk into a duty free shop at the airport i might return it Not worth the money I have spent money on La Mer and SkI and other amazing products Dont think this is worth the money Nice subtle scent and fancy bottle therefore 3 stars I really love this brand and really wanted to love this product I used it for somewhere around 12 months once or twice a day to give it a fair chance before reviewing Pros it really does seem to pull out any leftover makeup thats still on your face after washing Cons dries out skin at times runs out quickly causes breakouts and actually made my skin uneven at times probably because it dried out certain areas of my face Also I saw a ton of other reviewers saying that this toner doesnt contain alcohol or water but beware it actually contains both Im glad that this seems to work for other peoples skin but not mine For reference I have combination skin oily in tzone normal everywhere else overall this toner is absolutely not anything special and doesnt last long and therefore not worth the 50 price I am also attaching a photo of the ingredient list to this review\\nread more For the price that it was it did nothing Skin has been getting dry from weather but this didnt really give me any extra moisture for my skin It didnt irritate my skin so thats a plus It did smell really good After using this toner for a few months i noticed no differences My skin was more dry after using the toner compared to other toners And now i have dry patches and itchy skin I dont notice any other changed either What I liked The smell on this product is amazing I love how good it smells I find the scent very calming for the night time It made my skin very smooth and helped with my redness and helped fade my scars What I didnt like Before using this toner I was using the ORIGINS mega mushroom toner which contains 67 fl oz for 3500 this toner was great it had an earthy smell to it and also helped with redness and hydration but I decided to try Amorepacific since I heard really good things about it but the thing that disappointed me was that the bottle tricked me it was very huge and thought wow 50 for a lot of product not bad but then I found out it was only 34 floz they really like to trick ppl with bottle sizespackaging  I bought this product on July 25th and i am running out already and its August 21  I use this product day and night Overall I would recommend this item since I did see results and enjoyed it Just the amount of product you get makes me a bit upset I would of done a comparison of the origins bottle but I threw it away already\\nread more This toner feels great on the skin and works with the other products I use After several years of dealing with adult acne I finally realized that I had been treating it the wrong way I came to a realization that I had dry acne prone skin after believing for a long time that I had oilycombination The strong AHAs and high pH cleansers I had been using were irritating my dry skin and causing me to constantly break out with pustules I change my cleanser to an hydrating one switched to this Amorepacific treatment toner layered it with vitamin C the ordinary niacinamide and moisturizer My skin has never been better Being African I got lots of dark spots from my previous skincare routine but now I only have a few left I only break out during that time of the month I am currently looking out for an alternative as this runs out very quickly I am now on my second bottle\\nread more This is a no for me I try to stay away from products that contain alcohol or any sort of added fragrance This has both But I tried it out anyway because it has plenty of hydrating ingredients that I do look for in a toner But the scent from this is very strong and not nearly as hydrating as I hoped it would be If youre looking for hydration try the Rose Deep Hydration Facial Toner by Fresh or the Vanilla Milk Toner by Kylie Skin\\nread more Ive been using this for 2 months now with the Amore foam cleanser and the essential cream fluid It doesnt cause irritation Its a fine toner but you may be able to get a cheaper one for the same price One thing the rep told me is to pat the product directly onto your face instead of with a cotton pad It certainly saves product I will probably keep using it because its hard to find toners that are just right Love love this The packaging is elegant and the smell is out of this world has some calming effects to my sense of smell for some reasons I use this as part of my nightime routine It is absorbed very quickly and felt mosturizing Really really like this cleanser It helps a lot with redness Doesnt do much for treating or preventing acne but it is a nice gentle cleanser to use underneath other acne products This wasnt the worst wash ever but did not impress me at all So many better options Returned Didnt like this product I have dry textured red skin and I was really excited about this but I found it literally does nothing The only thing Ive noticed from using this is that it has made my skin even rougher and bumpier It didnt really leave me with that squeaky clean feeling either Not worth the price for a product that doesnt do much It does smell nice though I ended up returning it Con my eye hurts not gentle as labeled my skin feels dry after using Pro a little goes a ling way lather well This is just an eh cleanser for me It smells good sweet but clean and thats probably the biggest pro for me On its own it cleanses just fine but after rinsing my dry skin feels tight and overly cleansed I like it best when used after a cleansing balm because the pair together dont leave my skin feeling tight Definitely wouldnt go out of my way to use it again Firstly I have very dry skin and NEVER get pimples I was so excited to try this since its clean skincare After using it a few times I had 3 huge pimples on my face along with small red bumps My skin is normally smooth but now very textured and bumpy I threw it in the trash and will go back to the YTTP cleanser This was a total fail for me Love the smell of this product My skin did feel nice and soft afterwards but thats about it I dont know if it had to do with the other two Glow Recipe products that I was using with it watermelon moisturizermask but I did get brake outs Not a fan was very irritating on my eyes and didnt do much I purchased the small bottle and after going through it without any complaints I decided to purchase the larger bottle After a couple washes I began forming red dots all over my cheek area I have pretty normal skin very rare breakouts etc you have been warned Not a huge fan of this I dont find it does much to my skin and the texture is quite thick for a cleanser Love Glow Recipe Love this product it gets the job done but I find there are better products around the same price range Wanted to love this but it feels like washing your face with soap Ive got combination skin and this made my face feel so tight and horrible Please dont waste your money Theres so many gorgeous cleansers out there for half or less this price This is my goto cleanser I enjoy the light fragrance and it leaves my face clean and refreshed I knocked it down a star for being somewhat drying I only use this a few times a week and only a peasize amount The rest of the week I cleanse with the La Mer Micellar cleansing water I read another reviewer who commented on the instruction to avoid the eyes As I understand La Mer reps only recommend products specifically formulated for the eye area to be used around the eyes period Which in this regiment is the Micellar water for cleansing\\nread more Dries my not dry skin and has an unpleasant odor to it A complete waste if money in my case This product is a green cream that foams up nicely and it feels really nice and silky on the skin However I have oily skin sensitive skin and this product made my face feel tight It was a strange feeling because it didnt look like it stripped my face as it left a residue on my face that made my face look shiny But my face still felt tight and uncomfortable I bought the small 25 tube and ended up returning it after 2 uses I wanted to try a different cleanser and expected more from this product because I heard it was supposed to be a hydrating cleanser but no cleanser has worked for me like Cetaphils Gentle Cleanser\\nread more The cleanser smells like a bad of soap honestly it makes my skin feel so tight I wonder if thats to get you to use the moisturizer afterwards It doesnt seem to have much affect on my skin The LOréal micellar water I use seems better I am a La Mer lover much to the distress of my bank account and feel bad saying it But I dont think Ill be purchasing this again and am glad I only bought the mini very good product it makes my skin look so fresh and clean to be honest this face wash is okay for daily wash of the oil skin or the combination However it may be not good for the sensitive and dryness skin Why you notice this product is solution of dryness Do you know this product have the combination of the amino acid and soap base face wash Even though it has amino part the soap base is still the soap base And soap base is not good for the dryness and sensitive skin\\nread more Meh i prefer the cleansing gel over this cream Not worth the money Good foam wash but it didnt remove traces of make up this was the first la mer product I ever bought and tbh its best to skip this one and invest in their cream instead this leaves your face so tight and stripped not to mention it caused breakouts and small bumps on my cheeks the price for the mini is also ridiculous I will be going back to a different cleanser will say it does clean your face real good but it isnt worth for breakouts and dry skin I like this cleanser It doesnt overly dry your skin i have oily skin and it has helped to speed up the clearing of my breakouts Its just a bit expensive Im sure there are other cleansers likes this for a better price Its green with little exfoliating beads in it that I also like It turns into a foam like texture when wet and a little goes along way I swear I had this bottle for over a year Do I like it YES Do I love it No Would I purchase this again NO Would I recommend The sample size yes This isnt a bad Cleanser BUT even for a travelsamplesmall size whatever you want to call this 1oz its expensive 25 for this tiny bottle Its SUPER small so beware I couldnt get over how small the tube was and the cleanser itself is not a miracle or holy grail cleanser therefore I couldnt see myself paying 95 for the largerfull size The cleanser however did cleanse my skin good without leaving it tight stripped or dry It actually left my skin smooth and feeling hydrated The scent didnt smell luxurious or anything but it wasnt bad Its like a fresh light green Irish spring soap kind of smell and I expected more from La Mer as far as that It did have a great latherfoam to it and a little bit goes a long way Good enough for me not to return this but I wont repurchase it and cant say I will recommend this over something else first\\nread more Noticeable has decreased the size of my pores This light exfoliating cleaners has changed

tried this product This cleanser broke me out SO BAD Used it for about two weeks and ended up returning it Wasnt very exfoliating I returned because I prefer my usual cleanser I received the age reform ahabha exfoliating cleanser and I loved that so much I bought the full size This is the hydration but this is nice as well Its great to use this as a follow up cleanser but if you have a full face of makeup this will not remove everything completely If I dont have makeup and I use this as a normal cleanser it leaves my skin soft Not the best as a deep cleanser This was more of an impulse buy I shouldve known better for my skin My skin type is combination but a little more sensitive to dryness I also have scars The first night I put it on it immediately dried up my skin It didnt feel fresh nor like it was really cleansing my skin It feels like the type of dryness you get with a bar of soap Like nothing Thats usually not a good sign for me I had to moisturize several times in the span of a couple hours\\nread more This product is the worse facial cleanser I have ever tried It left my skin dry flaky and tight despite moisturizing afterwards I would never buy this product again It is very hydrating I have a very sensitive dry skin I needed something that would exfoliate my face without the beads burning my face This was manageable for my sensitive skin The front of the packaging says hydration but this product left my skin SO dry I wouldnt consider my skin to be sensitive but after about one week of daily use of this product I had skin peeling around my eyes and corners of my nose This product does a great job of removing makeup but it is too drying for daily use I was just getting into skincare and using toners so I selected this one because it says moisturizing which I need I didnt get the chance to see if I liked it more long term because it was very scented after using it one time and was the only new thing I was using I woke up with small white bumps on my face I have dry sensitive acne prone skin and I think it was the fragrance in this that was causing the slight irritation\\nread more Love the light scent and it does the job of hydrating after washing the face Its a plus that its a clean product Husband also loves it I tried this product based on reviews and I liked what I read Ive been using this product for almost a month now and I notice that by being consistent it keeps my skin looking radiant free of zits on my face and its super light Doesnt dry out my skin at all My face feels super smooth Only thing is that the smell of it is a bit unpleasant Must be because its natural and plant based I dont know but it has a bit of a funky smell Other than that Im happy I pitchs this product\\nread more It didnt work for me as I have rosacea and using it just seemed to irritate my skin even more as it tingled and made it red I would recommend it to people that dont have sensitive skin I really wanted to like this product as I loved their eye cream but it gave me the worst allergic reaction all over my face I really wanted an alcohol free toner and this one was nice Pretty pricy I think because its supposed to be clean but my skin hasnt really changed significantly since using it and I dont feel significantly cleaner after This is an OK toner The pump doesnt work why does toner even need a pump so i have to unscrew and remove the pump to use it Used it for about a year Usually love caudalie products but didnt notice much of a difference Stinky I wasted my money I dont even think that it made any changes in my skin I have tried another Caudalie toner but felt it dried out my skin too much so I tried this one thinking it would be gentler Instead it gives me very noticeable redness in the cheek areas and bumps I will never purchase another Caudalie product ever Love this toner I use it more in the warmer months 4 12 stars because when I do have an eczema flareup it can sting But when Im fine it does wonders Over all it is a good product However as I have sensitive skin I failed to notice this contains alcohol It stinks my skin a bit when I use it If you have sensitive skin and you want to try this product perhaps you should get Clarifying Lotion 10 which doesnt contain alcohol like I would do next time  Pros lasts such a long time Easy to use You can physically see the grime come off of you use a cotton pad which is super satisfying Cons Super drying I feel like its aging my skin as the alcohol in it just zaps any life out of it and I have very oily skin While it cleans it the gunk it isnt necessary I find that If i actually double cleanse and properly remove my makeup I dont need a toner to do the job Its just extra money wasted on a step that couldve been done with an effective cleanser But if you really need a toner and love the exfoliation Id recommend finding one that doesnt have alcohol in it You might think itll work fabulously with oily skin but its honestly just plain drying Will not be repurchasing and if I do decide to bother with toners again in the future Ill be sure to find one that doesnt include alcohol\\nread more I have sensitive skin but my skin is pretty good and usually doesnt react to most products However I used this for a day and the next morning acne started showing up At first I just thought it was a new cleansing oil I bought but when I did my skincare routine the next night I realized it was this product Right after using this product I saw my skin get super red and irritated It also started burning to the point that I had to stop using it Needless to say I will not be buying this product in the future\\nread more I really like the effect on my skin but this product unfortunately breaks me out I have combination skin and it dried out my skin you really have to moisturize afterwards  It was only until recently that I discovered that any tonerlotion containing alcohol or denatured alcohol is part of the seven deadly sins of skincare To my astonishment after taking a hiatus from Clinique and repurchasing this bottle I found that in the ingredients Denatured Alcohol is unabashedly listed I had been using this lotion for a week and I reflected on my skin I noticed my skin was breaking out like crazy fine lines were starting to form all over my face there were areas of drynesscoarseness that werent there before Sadly I will no longer use this product When Alcohol free toners and videosarticles on how alcohol in skincare is the primary for early signs of aging how can Clinique not get with the program and continue to sell this product\\nread more It thins skin I use it only 3 times a week yet it itches and irritates it makes my skin sensitive i cannot use witch hazel niacinamide tea tree products vitamin c after it or Ill have to go through a 5 day healing process with my skin which is NOT sensitive and I dont know how to deal with it now it worsened my acne scars and makes skin red and itchy i mean I can actually see the BLOOD VESSELS THOROUGH MY SKIN what is this supposed to mean exceot that its damaging my skin barrier and thinning my skin duh you dont have to harm your sin sis\\nread more Its so harsh gave me tiny red bumps all over my face esp on the pores Witch hazel toner wouldve been better and cheaper am using Caudalie now lets see how that does Has a lot of alcohol in it but most clarifying products do Id recommend for someone with normal to oily skin I have combination skin and it didnt work for me This items stings and burns my eyes Its expensive and you have to use a lot I used to just use regular lotion and this is harder than lotion and way more expensive I regret wasting 25 for it I love this product but hate the bottle The top always breaks My brand new bottle wont even dispense Super frustrating No matter how carefully I applied this still irritated my eyes and that is not common for me I dont have sensitive eyes or anything Super uncomfortable Wanted to love this product after a search for a remover for the sensitive skin around my eyes This product stings Definitely not for my sensitive eyes I also dont like how you need to use a lot Two stars because it works This is an amazing makeup remover gets rid of everything from waterproof mascara and eyeliner to and stubborn stuck on lash glue I repurchased this many times for years now its great if you have sensitive eyes The only issue I have with it is that with every one Ive gotten the pump broke Whether it was a mini or a full size the pump always broke But with that being said I still continued to repurchase the product I would still recommend it\\nread more Honestly love the product but the pump was defective on mine before even being able to use Unfortunately this product burned my eyes and was not sensitive at all I was dissapointed with Make Up For Ever as I do love their makeup Was excited to try this product because it was for sensitive eyes Removes make up great even my Japanese mascaras Heroine and Majorlica Majorlica However think my eyes are more sensitive as the product stings and irritates my eyes Think this would be very helpful to those who dont have sensitive eyes and uses mascara that are hard to remove I dont know if it has to do with the makeup products I use but this is awful whenever I use this it stings my eyes I am usually very tolerant to all skin makeup and eye products but this is horrible Do not bother purchasing I recommend Klorane instead Burn for approximately 10 to 15 minute my eyelids was painful after when i touch it everytime i use it Not for sensitive skin well not mine And been more then 30days so i cant exchange it Not a makeup person so its suck that the 3 time i use it in the 3 month it was painful I find this product leaves more makeup behind then it removes Its pretty good against eyeshadows but when it comes to eyeliner mascara and liquid eyeshadows it doesnt do much I understand waterproof makeup is hard to take off but my mascara I use isnt waterproof and it still gets left behind I find the product gets in my eyes very easy even when they are closed tightly then it just burns Would not buy again or reccomend\\nread more Now that Urban Decay Meltdown is no longer available this is the next best thing its way better than the oils and remove all of the eye makeup I have been struggling with adult

comes my mixed review I have oily skin with the occasional breakout Whenever I do get that break out I use this cleanser and it is gone honestly within a day It is magic I have never used a product that yielded such immediate results BUT this dries out my skin like crazyyy My makeup will sit on my face in dry patches for a few days after Im finished using this And thats coming from a girl with an oil slick face normally I will continue to use this for my breakouts until I find something better but beware of the dry skin aftermath\\nread more This cleanser has done nothing to clear or prevent breakouts on my face Still get them on a weekly basis even though I wash my face with this stuff daily Its probably a good cleanser for some people but it made my skin breakout terribly Was really excited to try it Just isnt the right thing for me If I could give it 0 star I would My husband never had severe break out before using this product He has more acnes and break outs starting from his lower cheeks to the sides of his forehead His skin was so dry everytime he used it I DO NOT recommend this product I dont normally write reviews But this product is horrible I dont have bad acne and only got this to clear up my blackheads on my nose After using this product I have developed so much acne everywhere on my face It made me break out in small pimples everywhere Stay away from this product this is happening to a lot of people I have had this product for a week and it made my skin so dry  I was really excited about this cleanser but I definitely would say for people who have somewhat sensitive skin that it is not the cleanser for them I have pretty bad acne and this really clears it and reduces redness Despite the amazing results this product dries your skin out pretty badly I just make sure i moisturize my face after I use this wash and then Im all good It works pretty well Good products but only suitable for using when acne stresses me badly Need layering moisturizers after use Dried my skin out very badly made my breakouts even worse and caused more breakouts to appear It tingles quite a bit around my mouth and nose which irritated my skin and left it very red around my nose This product chemically burned me After 2 days of use my entire face got dry and itchy then it got completely swollen and red Ive had a chemical peel before and my skin didnt even react this way So painful Stay away An acne friendly face wash that doesnt completely strip your face of oils It helps with oil control for sure My face personally doesnt like salicylic acid so I broke out  but it worked great on my boyfriend I did notice it helped keep the face moisturized even if its for acne I used this product for three days and had to stop using it sue to how drying it was I do feel it helped my acne but it was so drying it left my skin feeling bumpy and itchy I think ill give it another try after my skin recovers a bit and then try using it just once a week I bought this during the black friday sale at my local sephora because it was at such a great price I looked online and the reviews seemed great so I was really optimistic but it wasnt nearly as beneficial as I thought it would be Pros Smells amazing Super nice texture and it suds up super well and makes skin feel clean Nice packaging Removes makeup pretty well Cons  Makes my skin feel extremely dry immediately after use I have yet to see any antiacne properties Overall I think this has a lot of potential but its just lacking at a lot of key points Note I have combo leaning oily

skin and its extremely acne prone\\nread more I purchased this off another website but I wanted to leave my review on here I am rating this harshly based on the price When I spend money on high end products I expect them to be amazing not mediocre Unfortunately this cleanser is mediocre It is gentle and feels nice on the skin I didnt experience and break outs or negative reactions using this If you are sensitive to scents or dont like using skincare products that have a scent this isnt for you My complaint is that it doesnt remove all my makeup It doesnt remove eyeliner or mascara completely and Ive used other cleansers that do the job I double cleanse of course but I do have high expectations when using cleansing balms The ingredients in this arent luxurious to me and not worth the high price tag I am in love with the Drunk Elephant cleanser Those ingredients are better no scent removes all my makeup cheaper and cruelty free Eve Loms cleanser was a no from me and I dont think I would try any of their other products in the future\\nread more i like the smell and it really helps removing the make up This feels like an elegant Vicks vapor rub  same texture lighter fragrance Doesnt clean my pores They became clogged with gunk Very expensive face wash More like washing money out of your wallet Will be returning I bought this product back in August and have used this for a week and it broke me out horribly And until now still recovering from the break outs Feels luxuries to put it on The smell is really comforting I like it better than the Farmacy one but fourstar because its pricy I use a lot of makeup and this is a great cleanser to easily remove all of my makeup I love how the oil base helps my dry skin to stay moisturizer and I get a beautiful glow afterwards The only down side is the smell that I am not that fond of But not a dealbreaker either This was a good cleansing balm It did a good job of taking off my makeup and I like that it came with a cleanskng cloth When I first received this product I was super excited to try it out after reading all the good reviews Unfortunately it didnt work out for me since I have sensitive acne prone skin After a few days of using it I noticed more breakouts than the usual and the only new product I had started using was this cleanser Even though it made my skin breakout I must admit it worked really great after I removed my makeup  I received this complimentary from eve lom for reviewing purposes\\nread more This cleanser was great a first but then it really started drying out my skin Big fan of this product However it does leave a sort of film on my face that I need to wash off for a longer time than most exfoliants This is a gentle exfoliator it is good but its way overpriced for the tiny amount you get in a tiny jar i prefer other exfoliators especially at price point its just ok Its not a strong clean srub for the face Its cant clean the pores on my nose After using it you feel your face is very smooth Thats all it was too much for my skin unfortunately after using it I was left with a film like moisturizer on my skin that clogged my pores and caused me to break out my mom used it and it really worked for her but it just wasnt my cup of tea It smells fantastic and does admittedly make my skin feel smoother after use I just dont think that the effects are worth the price and small amount of product you receive The sugar also disappears very quickly I dont regret buying but I wont be repurchasing simply because of the price If you do purchase make sure to leave on for the recommended time it really does impact the results I really like this product I like that the sugar in it melts as your scrub your face so that you dont scrub for too long I use it every other day and it seems to exfoliate my face pretty well Im not crazy about the smell and I think its a little pricey Smells SO good This scrub is great for exfoliating and makes your skin so soft Ive used this scrub about 3 times now and its very gentle and smells amazing Hasnt caused a bad reaction to my picky skin My only complaint is that its a little thin Wish it was thicker so that it wouldnt slide off my face so easily Love this Makes my face feel clean Love the smell Ive used PTRs Irish Moor Mud for over a year and loved it Sephora stopped carrying it so ai switched to this since they have similitude acids But this one broke me out Im not sure if its due to the strong fragrance or the stronger acids but this product left my skin dry and broken out Amazing face wash but I have to say this dried out my face completely I thought I could make it work with a heavier face moisturizer but my face is still flaky It does a great job of brightening complexion and bringing breakouts out of the skin All my pimples are gone But unfortunately I might have to return this if decreasing the use of this to just once a week does not work Im so in love with it but its too harsh and I have normal skin I would only recommend this for oily skin types\\nread more I recently got the gift set with my points and didnt realize this cleanser makes your skin sensitive to the sun I appreciate the information was written on the packaging but didnt realize how sensitive It also doesnt help that I take medication that makes my skin photosensitiveI had figured since Im so careful about the sun already sunscreen staying out of sun hats etc that I would be safe but I still managed to get a small sunburn on my skin which as we all know causes damage Im disappointed in my lapse in judgement but I also think products like this should be phased out Natural products are the way to go\\nread more This face wash left my skin feeling so dry and tight after using it every night for about a week It also has a pretty strong fragrance and the packaging is terrible I brought this with me traveling where it spilled all over my bag and ruined the box that it came in even though the cap was screwed on all of the way Ive been using this cleanser for about 10 months now and it has been great to me I have occasionally breakouts a couple pimples once a month and this has been great at keeping them controlled it has a soft and fresh scent very gentle on my face no redness or tight feeling after I wash my breakouts have tapered down since I started using this cleanser so it does help with acne if that is what you are looking for after using it my face feels clean and soft I would definitely repurchase this cleanser once I run out and do recommend it it is well worth the price considering it can last a long time\\nread more Its is a big bottle and the smell and consistency is great  Wouldnt use daily as it is a bit drying but overall is an excellent cleanser  I bought this when it was 50 off so my expectations werent quite as high but I am very pleased with this cleanser Its very thick so its worth taking the time to really emulsify it in the palm of your hands before applying to the face I love the lather it makes and it really does remove makeup well I typically use an oil cleanser before a gel but I can get away with just this if Im feeling lazy It doesnt strip my skin or make it sensitive although looking at the ingredients there are quite a few surfactants I might not recommend this for some with super sensitive skin\\nread more i have sensitivedry skin and this is literally awful sometimes i think it just makes my face greasy if I dont use a different cleanser after this one im 24 and i have dry acne prone skin cystic acne prone and this was horrible i used it for a week and my skin was so so dry and peeling like crazy which caused me to break out  sample this before u buy it if u have a similar skin problems  all the reviews w the same skin type as me i noticed are experiencing the same issues gonna stick to my youth to the people cleanser The cap is horrible but its a good soap compare to the price but I dont think Ill buy it again because of the cap issue as all the soap in the cap and wasted The packaging sucks This is the second time Ive bought this product and had the same issue The cap is tight and closed and when I come to use it open it the product is all over the lid I only bought it when it was on sale for 10 and remembered why I had said I would never buy it again Now as far as the product its okay It doesnt irritate my sensitive dry acne prone skin But I also dont feel like it removes my makeup the way FAB does which I will be returning to It also doesnt have a scent overall its just okay Still would recommend but theres better out there\\nread more I really do love this product I have repurchased it in the past and it lasts a long time for the price I will not be repurchasing in the future due to the fact Keihls tests on animals It didnt work well with my dry skin It actually made my skin worse I wouldnt recommend if you have dry sensitive skin Really like this cleanser A little goes a long way and leave my skin soft clean and bright Non drying Great cleanser for the price point Sadly I will be returning this product I heard so many good things but it just doesnt work for my skin My acne has gotten sooo bad in the course of a week of using this product It does a good job at cleaning makeup but is super drying Not good if you have acne prone skin Sephora absolutely describes this cleanser accurately Im always interested in trying out new cleansers for various reasons But I thought Id try this with the thought of using it in the morning when I just want a light non stripping cleanser andor after steaming my face I feel like although this is lightweight and a clean product I feel like I needed more than a usual amount dime size to really reach my whole face and enough to feel like Im able wash it away It doesnt run or warm up it sits like a gel cream So in my opinion I prefer to keep using either Caudalie Foaming Cleanser YTP Green Cleanser and Korres Greek Yoghurt Cleanser Theyre clean lather are gentle moisture balancing non stripping and I always feel like my face is fully clean afterwards I imagine this is a great product for someone with very oily skin ultraultra sensitive skin or even for a younger teen starting out a skin care regimen\\nread more It has weird smelllike detergents I rarely use it because of the smell definitely better than the drug store brand they dont crumble up when you swipe across your face i use these with my toner and to take my makeup off at the end of the day While not revolutionary these cotton pads are a lot better than the cheaper ones youll buy at the drugstore Theyre a lot more sturdyIm a guy and even the slightest stubble will rip drugstore ones apart Super absorbent will definitely repurchase Not as soft as I thought after reading all the raving reviews Not sure what happened there A little rough and thin There are better ones at the supermarket These are weirdly very nice cotton pads for toner Very soft and gentle A little pricey for what you get but they are nice I use them for makeup removing and it takes about two pads to clean my makeup off I only wear tinted moisturize and mascara most days Kinda hard for my face It is not gentle as I expected after reading review The two sides of the pad separate pretty easily but the actual material is sturdy unlike other brands Ive tried that completely fall apart Overall these performed well and I will be repurchasing once I run out I found that this clenser worked just like any clenser ive used before I didnt really notice a difference in my skin but everyone has different types of skin this one just didnt really work for me This is the most drying cleanser I have ever tried Ive tried this on its own and after using a cleansing balm and both ways made my skin painfully dry For this price point you can do so much better a bit pricey Smells pretty good Ive been using this cleanser from the SKII travelsize set for the past week and it is a good basic cleanser Ive never been able to get it to foam like the model does in the demonstration video but it does lather enough to serve its purpose and cleanse the skin The scent is a very light soapy smell which is nice And once the cleanser is washed away skin feels clean and not over dried However this cleanser is not very well suited for my breakoutprone skin because I need something either with more texture to scrub the skin or stronger acnetargeting ingredients to reduce my breakouts Ive reduced a star on this rating because it doesnt do a good job of addressing my breakouts and reduced another star because of the high price for such a basic cleanser Im a huge fan of SKII products but dont think the price is quite justified on this particular one This cleanser would be wellsuited for someone primarily focused on maintaining clean skin without any major skin concerns I on the other hand will probably use this sample until its all gone and then go back to the cleanser I used before Ill update this review if my opinion changes once the entire sample is used up\\nread more I have been using this cleanser for over a year It is very pricey but worth it You only need a tiny bit and the tube lasts a long time I have sensitive skin and this is great My face has gotten brighter after a few month of using this My skin feels smooth and soft It definitely does the job This product cleanses well and leaves my skin feeling smooth However these claims can certainly be made with lesserpriced cleansers I also found the scent to be too strong for my liking I wont return this purchase and Ill use it until the end but I certainly wont repurchase this item Save your money for other SKII products like their essence This product worked really well and my skin felt great after But I dont think its worth the price I would pay 40 for this but not over 70 This product is crazy good Im not crazy about there being denatured alcohol in this but it is still a lovely product that brings the results I wish they made it in a bigger bottle but the price cant be beat when compared to the results My skin felt so incredibly smooth after using it only once I will be repurchasing product contain microbeads I received a sample of RubADub and was so excited to try it but after I found out it contains MICROBEADSI feel guilty using it I thought MICROBEADS is ban in the states Super drying Leaves skin with the squeaky clean feeling Doesnt get off all the makeup Also smells odd I bought this last week and Im not impressed This is the first time Ive tried a peel and I heard good things about it so I thought Id try it out but it hasnt helped my skin at all I didnt notice any differences after using it a couple times in fact it made my skin feel very dry This product is crazy good Im

differences after using it a couple times in fact it made my skin feel very dry This exfoliator was too coarse and made my acneprone skin breakout The minty smell was nice Clinique products are usually safe to use on my acneprone skin but this product didnt work out I had to return it this stuff works great and my boyfriend loves it my only issue is it tingles almost like a minty feeling on your face and leaves my sensitive skin red cliniques 7 day scrub is perfect though if your skin is like mine if you have normal skin this stuff will work wonders One of the best scrubs that my daughter has tried so far this is my 2nd tube I tried so hard to like this product as its main claim to clean pores and prevent acne with its salicylic acid I had zero benefits regarding that it just makes your skin irritated stinks but smooth I couldve easily got the same benefits from a 5 drug store product or a DIY sugar and olive oil scrub Unfortunately these burned my eyes like many of the other sephora face wipes There is something in the ingredients that makes my eyes burn so much These wipes didnt remove anything I was so disappointed I cant believe there are so many 5 star reviews The mini one is soooooo small that the package fits in the palm of my tiny hand Waaaaay overpriced The smell great But if you wear waterproof eye liner these really are sub par I tried these on recommendation from one of the Sephora employees and was very disappointed I had to scrub and scrub my eye lashes to remove most of my dior waterproof mascara and lost a couple lashes in the process After I finish this pack i am going back to the nuetrogena drug store brand These wipes smell good I thought theyd smell like candy but they just smelled like a nice shower type smell They take of makeup and are definitely hydrating but they irritated my eyes after several uses I purchased the travel size to try and had high hopes but they didnt work for me When I swiped my eyes to take off makeup they made my eyes burn kind of similar to how it feels when you get soap in your eyes Just not good at all\\nread more Please bring back the old fragrancefree nongreasy wipes All this exfoliating and fruit scented stuff gives me a headache pros 1 removes makeup even waterproof eyeliner 2 smells nice cons 1 each sheet was very small about half the size of regular makeup remover wipes maybe it was because I purchased the trial size package The wipes work well but I was disappointed in the lack of fragrance I used these wipes to take off my makeup but they didnt work very well wouldnt recommend for dry skin the smell is so fruity and fresh and I love the way these wipes make my skin feel but I did find that the coconut one worked better for me This rating is based less on the product itself and more so on the change in price and size of the product This is an observation Ive made and I thought that it would be beneficial for anyone thinking of buying or repurchasing this product For approximately the last year I have been exclusively using Sephoras watermelon wipes I like them they make my skin feel clean without feeling overly dry or too greasy they typically remove nearly the entirety of my eye makeup and they smell quite nice But it looks like Sephora is changing things up in order to save a penny The last two times I purchased these wipes were on February 22 2019 and April 26 2019 both times purchased online and the wipes have significantly decreased in size in that one month period I have also noticed that they have slightly increased the price as well which I normally wouldnt have minded as much so long as the product itself remained the same The February wipes Lot 81560 in the attached picture on the right cost 750 and measured in at 18 cm by 19 cm The April wipes Lot 8257E on the left now cost 800 and measure in at 195 cm by 135 cm The second I took the first April wipe out of the package I couldnt find the Feb package I had already opened I instantly thought that the wipe seemed quite a bit smaller than usual and the shape was off But it wasnt until today May 9 that I was able to find the Feb package to directly compare the two You can see in the attached picture that the newer wipes on the left are much smaller than the older ones on the right While it is certainly possible that this particular April lot is oddly shaped because of the release of the new mini size I personally dont think that is the case Based on the dimensions of the wipes and after a bit of quick math were essentially losing 575 wipes in each package So really were paying 50 cents more for only 19 wipes now TLDR We are paying more for nearly 6 fewer wipes now\\nread more As soon as I used the wipes my eyes stung Had to use eye bath to rinse them out Lovely smell but not for me I like these However I feel like either my skin has changed or the formula has changed This last package I bought isnt working for me as well as in years past Smells like an orange creamsicle Cloths are a lot larger than I expected but are alittle rougher than Id likeThe plastic opening clicks closed and has a good seal Dryer than drugstore makeup wipes I mean what are you actually paying for here Semi damp makeup remover wipes No thanks These smell amazing and for that reason Ill probably buy again Ive always used Neutrogenas make up remover wipes but wanted to try something cleaner These arent as hydrating and smooth but nothing a follow up moisturizer cant fix which Ive always done anyway Several brands of wipes burn my sensitive skin and cause redness but these dont do that Will purchase again Really great for removing makeup and for freshening up your face before moisturizing It has a subtle citrus smell and is super soft on the skin but as it dries definitely dont forget to moisturize It truly cleans your skin of any oils and everything so you will feel dry if you dont use a moisturizer afterwards These wipes are so heavenly They smell so good and leave my face feeling refreshed bright and glowing the results are pretty instant My only concern is they dont remove make up that well I generally use these after my make up and face has been cleansed or first thing in the morning to leave me feeling fresh Would recommended I have been using this product line for three years and decided to get these cleansing clothes for a vacation so I didnt need to bring my liquid face wash Unfortunately I really didnt like this product my face felt greasy and I broke out for the entire week I wont purchase again These cloths did not take my makeup off easily They felt rather dry These wipes are so moisturizing and smell so fresh They take off my eye makeup better than any wipe I have ever used before These are just ok I love the smell but they have a hard time removing my waterproof mascara without having to scrub at my eyes It does remove my foundation quick which is nice and they work when Im exhausted and need to at least get the majority of my makeup off Was super excited to try this cleanser Its a decent cleanser However it leave my face tighter than Im used to once I have rinsed my skin The smell isnt that great either Great for some not for me Will be returning sadly Ive been using this for 2 weeks  the Pros love the smell and it does a great job deep cleansing The Cons crazy how drying it is my entire face is flaking no matter how much moisturizer I use Will definitely be returning this I got Farmacys honey face mask with points and enjoyed it so I thought this would be fine I was wrong I have very oilymix skin rosacea on my cheeks so that area is dry oily tzone and this face wash dried my skin out My cheeks and forehead were flaking from how dry my skin got and I had to use my night moisturizer to combat it My face felt so tight it was almost painful I used the whole bottle so I didnt waste anything but I dont think Ill buy this again It did its job but definitely not for me\\nread more I really wanted to like this cleanser It felt nice on the skin and washed away easily but it just smelled SO STRONG it wasnt a bad scent but it was just way too strong for me I felt it was a little drying as well Returned after two uses unfortunately I was really excited to try this cleanser after my purchase however it left me disappointed While it does a great job cleansing it left my skin very dry I had to make sure I had a very hydrating moisturizer to follow up with If you have oily skin this may be a good go to I find this to be an effective cleanser but it does seem to be a tad irritating and slightly drying Before this I was using a cleansing oil so the formula switch might be effecting my skin a bit If this is a formula you enjoy I would recommend this as an option but if you are used to a balm or an oil Id stick with that For some reason I was under the impression this is more an oil while it is actually a gel or traditional liquid\\nread more Cleans very well and I feel like it helps minimize how noticeable the pores are on my nose Only thing is I do rinse it off with water If I just wipe and go I feel like my skin gets oily faster I also dont wear makeup so I cant really say anything about how effective it is at removing product Actually it is good product for the price but not miracle water with one shot you have to use two pads to remove all your makeup I wanted to LOVE this product Great brand I love that its clean and great for sensitive skin It was highly effective and quickly cleansing for everything EXCEPT for my waterproof mascara which was really the true test for me I tried it both using my fingers and by using a cotton pad But after going through a few cotton pads my mascara hadnt budged and my eye was getting sensitive from repeated gentle cotton pad cleansings I knew Id have to move onto something else\\nread more This is ok Didnt blow me away It also sometimes felt kind of soapy on my cotton pad Probably wouldnt purchase again This product is OK I dont have much loyalty when it comes to a toner or micellar water I like to use different brands I actually prefer the Biore one from CVS This is an excellent facial cleanser for everything but waterproof mascara and I am so accustomed to rinsing my face that it seems strange I like the mild formula and find it leaves my skin feeling good and fresh but just cant get over not rinsing I will use it until its gone but will get the wash away formula the next time I have been using this product for three years now However I use this as a toner and not to remove makeup I use bioderma for that I find its super gentle and removes any residue that my cleanser has left behind My ONLY issue is that this has fragrance Just straight up fragrance I just wish they would remove it because its really not necessary I especially wouldnt use this to remove mascara or eye makeup if it has fragrance in it I tend to have sensitive skin so thankfully this doesnt seem to irritate it though Allinall I swear by this brand they stand for a lot of great causes and put out fantastic products\\nread more I have been using this product for three years now However I use this as a toner

does One small thing though  the bottle is extremely hard and you have to squeeze it out to dispense the product I dont have any dexterity issues in my hand and it is still extremely difficult to get out I know thats such a strange thing to write in a review but really its not designed well If you have any issues with your hands dont buy this I used this product for years and it was fabulous Then I received the bottle with the sticker New Formula It is impossible to squeeze out of the bottle and is an awful mucuslike consistency Few exfoliating beads It will be my last purchase of this product Too bad because I used to love it The product is too thick for this bottle The bottle is too rigid to squeeze and the product is very difficult to get out A big hassle to use Just okay for me I had high hopes with all the good reviews Not necessarily bad but has shown no real sign of improvement with my skin Friendly to my dry skin for the most part Not very good at removing my light daily face makeup but gentle when removing my eye makeup It does a fine job I suppose Havent really seen a difference in my skin I got a mini size which is great for trips bc I usually use a similar brush to wash my face But a quick warning dont use this cleanser alone on a facial brush It works well if you use a foaming cleanser and just a drop of the exfoliating cleanser in the center of the brush which I do every few days Its great for when I dont take my brush with me and a little goes a long way so it lasts But using it alone on the brush totally hurt my face and in one place even broke the skin\\nread more I like the product but the bottle is such hard plastic it is virtually impossible to squeeze and get it out I have not been very happy with recent philosophy packaging The lotion I

every day face cleanser thinking its good but actually besides drying my face and not stopping the acne its overpriced for what it is I recently bought from target one with the same amount of salicylic acid in it for a fraction of the price and its not drying my skin and its clearing my skin way better than this did I love this I started breaking out when I turned 30 and couldnt fix it It doesnt scrub and is kind of expensive but I like the product I still use it but I also got the vibrating scrubber to help The consistency is terrible Its like putting water on my face I asked for a cleanser that could help with my acne and this product does not do that Worst Investment The price is nice thats the one reason why I choose to purchase this product and now I realize that price does matter This is a good solid acne cleanser for someone with far and few between breakouts When I stopped taking birth control pills I started breaking out randomly and I use this after my every day face cleanser  also Clinique supersonic face cleanser If used daily I find the product to be consistent and do what it says Purchased this for my teenager as I thought maybe wed try something else that would work better But I am extremely disappointed We tried it for 3 months but her acne got worse so were going back to what she was originally using So far it seems to be working I have only been using this for about 3 weeks I do see my skin clear in some areas but breaking out in others From what Ive been told this product will bring all the acne I have to the surface so my skin will get worse before it gets better really hoping thats true I do really love the clean feeling and only slightly dries out my skin I liked how it felt on my hand thats why I purchased this But once I had it on my face I didnt feel the moisture nor the satisfied feeling that its clean If I dont put toner right away it made my skin dry out I returned it i bought this since it had so much good reviews and ive been have lots of blemishes lately so i thought this could be a good product for me it really wasnt it actually made my blemishes look worse and after using it for 2 weeks it hasnt done anything at all i totally regret buying this I purchased this cleansing foam because the liquid one was not available at the moment at my local Sephora and I was in a rush Ive been using it for over 2 weeks and I noticed my skin breaking out a bit more than with the liquid one But overall it still does a good job Also I noticed this one dried my skin less than the liquid one Made me break out the first week of using it Everyone has different skin types but it personally didnt work well for me I broke out even more with this which im sad cause my friend loves it My skin is usually clear just tiny bumps but since I used this I got a big pimple that wont go away And it irritated my boyfriend skin on first use For the longest time I have been using this as an every day face cleanser thinking its

option I love these wipes They smell lovely and leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed Only drawback is they are not super great at removing mascara so I use a serious makeup remover for that I reuse these wipes a few times I use these wipes for general refreshing removing simple makeup like concealer and cleaning my fingers during makeup application They also do not dry or irritate my sensitive skin\\nread more it makes my eyes oily wouldnt buy again I love Kiehls products and already use the ultra facial moisturizer as part of my daily skincare routine so I decided to give this a go I was sadly disappointed as I really did not notice a difference in my skin at all from this toner It didnt have a negative effect on my skin it just really did not do anything at all  good nor bad So Id say this isnt worth the money I love my other Kiehls products and moisturizers and will continue to buy those but I wont be purchasing this toner again I must say however Ive tried 2 other toners before this one and didnt see a difference in my skin from those either so could just be my specific skin  mostly dry\\nread more It was ok wasnt as moisturizing as I hoped it to be At least it doesnt contain witch hazel which is very drying The feeling on my skin is nice but I would say no for the scent it smells weird to me I really wanted to like it It feels nice on the skin but it isnt moisturizing Looking at the ingredients I want to call this product bullcrap Phenoxyethanol is listed as the fourth or fifth ingredient followed by numerous other ingredients The maximum percentage of phenoxyethanol in the US is 1 that means all the other ingredients does little to nothing since its all less than one percent The majority of this toner is water with glycerin and some other ingredients thats relatively beneficial to the skin but nothing special Recently I started breaking out so I cut this toner out of my routine and it helped a lot It was a little too thick for my skin\\nread more it is an okay product did not do anything to my skin I would not recommend this to anyone kiehls doesnt make any good skincare product I dont feel like this product does anything will not purchase again I want to like it because its not very fragrant and our Tati gets but I feel like its too heavy for my oily skin and is Amusing breakouts and makes me face red I couldnt figure it what was causing it until I stopped using it Not for me Probably great for dry skin Very good smell Nothing stays on me for very long so I cant judge that part First when it came in the box it was leaking even though their was a seal on it so I really dont know what that liquid was The consistency was very liquidy like water but then after some time it solidified into a milky thicker consistency When I applied it on my face it was very sticky and dried down that way It also has a strong pen ink smell even though all these reviews say its odorless I dont know what to think but Im very disappointed If anyone can leave a review in reply about whether this is supposed to be happening or if you experienced the same thing I would be extremely grateful\\nread more Love Amorepacific more than I can explain and use their creams extensively in my skin routines But this is just too drying for meI have sensitive and super dry skin Smells lovely just like the rest of the brand and I cannot figure why this did not work for me Maybe for someone with oily nonsensitive skin I absolutely love Amorepacifics other products but this one just made my skin feel tight dry and miserable It actually caused some eczema around my eyes which has never happened to me before and only started within days of using this cleanser My skin isnt overly sensitive and is more combo than dry but this cleanser certainly did a number on me Its going back I really enjoy this cleanser The only reason I took a star off is the price My skin type seems to change a lot depending on the weather or what my hormones feel like doing and this cleanser works well regardless of what my skin is doing The scent is light and doesnt irritate my skin I have eczema around my eyes and this cleanser doesnt bother it It leaves my skin feeling clean but not tight It also seems to reduce how often I break out\\nread more I could not use this I dont mind perfume in my skincare and I otherwise like the AmorePacific fragrance but this is just ridiculous Every time I tried it my eyes would be filled with tears for 20 minutes afterwards Very irritating I usually would never spend 50 on a face cleanser but I splurged because I absolutely love the way this feels when Im using it to cleanse my face It feels so soft and luxurious as it lathers up and gently but effectively cleanses Also a tiny bit a product goes a long way with this so even though the cost is high it should last a while I docked a star off because it claims to help combat acne but I honestly havent see those kind of results and am not sure how it would since it doesnt have any of the typical acne fighting ingredients\\nread more I bought this because this was recommended by Sephora salesperson It does lather well and cleans my face well but I am not too crazy about the smell Its been only three days since I started using so maybe Ill get used to it but Im not impressed with so far for how much it costs This was such a waste of money I love all of AmorePacifics products but this hands down has to be the worst I have to was my face more than once with it and there is still makeup that hasnt been removed I used cotton pads with toner and see all the left over makeup thats still on my face Im not any water proof products so I dont get why it says it removes makeup when it doesnt I dont even want to give this a star It made me breakout crazy and my skin is in pain because of this face wash It made my skin feel super dry and terrible Stay away from this product if you have acne prone skin It doesnt clear up acne but it will help you to make you acnes worst Im going to return this product and go back to my old cleansing wash to clear up this mess It is terrible Face feels really clean without it being too dry I dont care too much about the warming effect though but its nice Horrible  Makes you get more pimples  It does give that fresh clean look on your skin but then you wake up with twice the pimples  I have been using this for a month maybe to see if my skin with get used to it but i have NEVER seen my skin so bad  And i usually dont get a lot of pimples on my face I thought this was okay as I got this in a boscia faves gift set for christmas I think theres a cheaper dupe thats sold at the drugstore with the warming effect My bf actually liked it and he decided he wanted to take it for himself I didnt see anything worthwhile from using it myself so I let him have it I used to break out in my twenties and thirties but since Ive been in my forties its a rare occurrence I started using this cleanser about two weeks ago and Ive been breaking out Because my acneprone days are behind me I feel confident this isnt a temporary purge The breakouts are even in odd places for me such as above my upper lip and on my neck I wish I knew which ingredient is the problem so I can avoid it in the future If you have even slightly breakout prone skin avoid this It didnt help with oil either\\nread

using this brand again I thought Id try this cleanser to help fight blackheads onaround my nose and chin To be honest this did nothing for me in the sense that my skin seemed to be unaffected by it after drying That being said if you dont have acne or blackheads live in a cold environment and simply want a cleanser that warms you up  this could be perfect for you Dont see a difference using this cleanser Does not clean very well Packaging sucks Thinking I was done was about to throw away Opened it plenty to use but didnt pump out no more Makes me think of how much money Ive previously thrown in trash Great product bad packaging After using Biores charcoal cleanser I thought about giving this one a try after all the rave about it After 3 weeks of using it Im extremely disappointed in this cleanser All it did was make my face extremely dry after washing giving me that ashy look Also it broke me out bad I had about 5 breakouts within a week I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt that it was purging my skin but the breakouts seem to get bad and my face is dry after use\\nread more This product does what it says it does I feel best results are when used in the shower when I dry my face off the drydead skin and just yuck come off It takes more product than I thought I havent owned for long enough to access the ration of being worth it I have eczema and this is the best face cleaner I have came across so I may value it more for that reason alone I dont care for the smell but I wouldnt say it sticks with you for longer than while applied\\nread more Ive tried other products like this and this was by far the worst Maybe it would work if I didnt have any hair on my face Takes forever to get the product off  definitely an exfoliant but not in a pleasant way I love

the peach fuzz near your jawline I dont feel like I have an unusual amount of hair on my face and this was a nightmare trying to scrub it off my fine hairs I was super pumped when I received his product However with the first use I was super disappointed The product got stuck in the fine hairs on my cheeks and chin Took forever to pullscrub off I have used and love the gel peel from Peter Thomas Roth and this just didnt compare at all Might be good for those with no fine hairs but definitely not for me I wanted to love thisreally I did I normally love Boscia stuff Unfortunately no matter how nice it smells how well it worked or didnt etc the fact that this pilled into tiny little balls which then clung for dear life onto all of the peach fuzz along my jawline was a HUGE deal breaker Took me forever to get the pilled balls off which irritated my skin and left it red I continued to find even more pilled balls attached to my super fine facial hair the next morning Beyond annoying HUGE BUMMER Cant believe anybody actually likes this stuff when there are sooo many other options available I returned it SIDE NOTE For those who think the little clumped balls that form are your skin being exfoliated please note that this is not the case The clumped balls are from the products ingredients clumping together which then act as exfoliants\\nread more Leaves face feeling smooth and new Great for at home light peel Let me preface this review with saying I am a huge skincare junkie I regularly get facials and am on top of my 2x daily skincare routine and regularly exfoliate I do not however dermaplane so I have very fine blonde hairs which have never caused a problem with any other skincare product Ive ever used I followed the directions listed on the bottle I did feel like it exfoliated certain areas of my face my forehead and cheeks especially Upon rinsing I noticed that it had balled up and literally adhered its self into my baby facial hairs It took scrubbing with a wet ole Henriksen complexion sponge a dry washcloth and some tweezers to get it completely off This left my jaw line red and inflamed I gave 2 stars because I feel like it did Exfoliate some areas but the sticking to my face will 100 make me return the product Not worth the 34 retail I paid There are other products on the market that deliver similar or better results without the pilling\\nread more Received as a sample Have used many exfoliating peels but this one is easily the worst The consistency and the way it feels on the skin is like nothing Ive experienced and not in a good way As others have stated if you have even a scant amount of hair on your face ie peach fuzz on your jaw line it is seriously impossible to get off I scrubbed with a wash cloth used a foaming cleanser etc  very painful Definitely not worth it\\nread more This is a tough one This stuff absolutely works its a great peel for sensitive skin and there is noticeable improvement in skin texture when I use it The downside is that this stuff sticks like glue to the peach fuzz on my face and needs to be thoroughly scrubbed off Because of that I use it less often than I would otherwise Does nothing for me Purchased as an alternative for Thomas Roth but it is not up to the level Had to return it unfortunately I wanted to try something different because I normally use PTR as an enzyme peel and Boscia usually has great products First I love that the packaging has a pump It smells great and I feel like its a lot more gentle while still getting the job done But like many other reviews it is pretty difficult to get off It sticks to all of my hair on my checks closer to my ears and I almost feel like I have to use a warm towel to get them off completely but I dont like to drag a towel across my face because its obviously too abrasive I have found using this product in the shower is better because you can just put your entire face under the shower head to rinse it off The only reason I cant give it a 5Star rating is because of the difficulty removing the product\\nread more Ive tried other products like this and this was by far the worst Maybe it would work if I didnt have

hair on my face and this was a nightmare trying to scrub it off my fine hairs I was super pumped when I received his product However with the first use I was super disappointed The product got stuck in the fine hairs on my cheeks and chin Took forever to pullscrub off I have used and love the gel peel from Peter Thomas Roth and this just didnt compare at all Might be good for those with no fine hairs but definitely not for me I wanted to love thisreally I did I normally love Boscia stuff Unfortunately no matter how nice it smells how well it worked or didnt etc the fact that this pilled into tiny little balls which then clung for dear life onto all of the peach fuzz along my jawline was a HUGE deal breaker Took me forever to get the pilled balls off which irritated my skin and left it red I continued to find even more pilled balls attached to my super fine facial hair the next morning Beyond annoying HUGE BUMMER Cant believe anybody actually likes this stuff when there are sooo many other options available I returned it SIDE NOTE For those who think the little clumped balls that form are your skin being exfoliated please note that this is not the case The clumped balls are from the products ingredients clumping together which then act as exfoliants\\nread more Leaves face feeling smooth and new Great for at home light peel Let me preface this review with saying I am a huge skincare junkie I regularly get facials and am on top of my 2x daily skincare routine and regularly exfoliate I do not however dermaplane so I have very fine blonde hairs which have never caused a problem with any other skincare product Ive ever used I followed the directions listed on the bottle I did feel like it exfoliated certain areas of my face my forehead and cheeks especially Upon rinsing I noticed that it had balled up and literally adhered its self into my baby facial hairs It took scrubbing with a wet ole Henriksen complexion sponge a dry washcloth and some tweezers to get it completely off This left my jaw line red and inflamed I gave 2 stars because I feel like it did Exfoliate some areas but the sticking to my face will 100 make me return the product Not worth the 34 retail I paid There are other products on the market that deliver similar or better results without the pilling\\nread more Received as a sample Have used many exfoliating peels but this one is easily the worst The consistency and the way it feels on the skin is like nothing Ive experienced and not in a good way As others have stated if you have even a scant amount of hair on your face ie peach fuzz on your jaw line it is seriously impossible to get off I scrubbed with a wash cloth used a foaming cleanser etc  very painful Definitely not worth it\\nread more This is a tough one This stuff absolutely works its a great peel for sensitive skin and there is noticeable improvement in skin texture when I use it The downside is that this stuff sticks like glue to the peach fuzz on my face and needs to be thoroughly scrubbed off Because of that I use it less often than I would otherwise Does nothing for me Purchased as an alternative for Thomas Roth but it is not up to the level Had to return it unfortunately I wanted to try something different because I normally use PTR as an enzyme peel and Boscia usually has great products First I love that the packaging has a pump It smells great and I feel like its a lot more gentle while still getting the job done But like many other reviews it is pretty difficult to get off It sticks to all of my hair on my checks closer to my ears and I almost feel like I have to use a warm towel to get them off completely but I dont like to drag a towel across my face because its obviously too abrasive I have found using this product in the shower is better because you can just put your entire face under the shower head to rinse it off The only reason I cant give it a 5Star rating is because of the difficulty removing the product\\nread more As other users have mentioned it worked for few weeks and caused me an extreme breakout due to over drying But I think it works good as a cleanser if you keep up with moisturizer and other skin care products so Ive been using this stuff for a few weeks now I cant stand the smell its terrible and smells like floor cleaner I am not convinced that its helping clean my face Very disappointing considering how expensive it is and now I dont know what do with it Bought for my boyfriend He likes it except for the smell Also he managed to break off the seal on the inside so now has to lean it upside down so it doesnt leak out Doesnt FEEL like it cleans very well however when I layered different kinds of makeup onto my hand primer color correct concealer lip liner and lipstick it took it all off with mild rubbing After four days of use it hasnt really dried my skin out however it doesnt leave it feeling very moisturized either Has a slight menthol smell Bought this for my fiancee and he found it effective for acne and redness but that it was very drying If you moisturize this would probably be a 4star review I havent noticed anything while using this toner other than it drys my skin out like crazy I still break out I just now have dry skin It works well as a toner Im just not sure it does anything for acne Does not cause acne to worsen or cause any more breakouts but it also doesnt make acne go away instantly It is very drying because of the alcohol but any moisturizer on top helps with that I have repurchased twice because it keeps the breakouts from getting worse and prevents new ones from coming I dont use it every day I only use it when my breakouts have increased and it helps clean my face I would keep this toner as part of skin care It helps not make things worse\\nread more I wish this line worked for my teenage but unfortunately were going back to what she was using And paying a bit more for clear skin I liked this product a lot i used it often but maybe too often it was a little drying on my skin I have combination skin and noticed under my nose and around my forehead was the driest Did well on my acne though probably because it was so drying lol Although Im new at sephora and using Clinique but this products seems good BUT IT DOES STINK AND ALMOST TOOK BACK FOR A LOT MORE GENTLE TONER BUT I NOTICED AFTER WASHING MY FACE THAT THE COTTON SWAB WAS STILL REAL DIRTY THE CLINIQUE TRUELY TOOK SHIRT OFF MY FACE NECK AND CHEST THAT IM WAS SHOCKED HOW DARK COTTON SWAB WAS This product has been great on my skin I have terrible acne prone skin around the mouth and along my chin This has helped clear up small bumps and most acne spots I still get the occasional breakouts but this has helped maintain clear skin between pesky hormonal blemishes Honestly I dont know if this is helping my skin i am on week 3 using the acne solutions system I do like the feeling when I apply it feels like its working somehow I really love this product It really help my acne make it disappear Unfortunately I have to stop using it realizing that this product has ALCOHOL DENT If they leave out that ingredient I would come repurchase this again Does

difference at all in my skin Still just as many breakouts and oil Almost done the full bottle and havent noticed a significant difference of the acne on my skin It smells great and feels nice on the skin but not strong enough to really do much First ingredients on bottle are dent Alcohol and perfume Trust me you dont have to read the bottle to know Such an intense smell and dries the face like crazy I literally had more lines on my face because it was so tight and dry like when a clay mask dries Not worth the purchase This toner made me breakout I have highly sensitive skin over the top of my lip At first the toner worked fine but then i started getting zits around my lip area I stopped using this toner and the breakouts calmed down Not going to repurchase I am not a person to get breakouts but once I started to use this toner my skin began to act up once I stoped using it my skin felt like it could breath again This product it not good Ive only used this product for about a month now so I wont be reviewing on my results but rather give information about what the product feels like to me To start it has a strong chemical smell Like a cleaning supply kinda vibe It turns from clear to milky when you rubpat it onto your face When I put this on I just feel slightly concerned because of the smell but it hasnt broke me out or anything at all Um Thats all Im indifferent but I guess my pores haveeee slightly gotten less noticeable idk tbh\\nread more This is not a good toner Ingredients are not good at all even if its a Clean product One of the first is alcohol denat wich is very drying and bad for sensitive and acne prone skin The perfuming of this is intense and again not good for acne or sensitive skin alot of essentials oils wich is natural but as bad as perfume On top of that there is allergen LimoneneCitronellol ect that can cause bad skin reaction and should be in no skincare There is better options in Sephora right now\\nread more Brought this product in store by being pressured by a consultant I find it does make your skin feel clean but doesnt do what it says it does I find my skin to be oily and dry more than anything now I really enjoy some of Caudalies other products so I figured Id give this a try But disappointed in my purchase Ive been giving it a chance for the past week but I dont recommend Noticed no difference at all in my

products so I figured Id give this a try But disappointed in my purchase Ive been giving it a chance for the past week but I dont recommend This feels like sandpaper I have never experienced wipes like these The rough side doesnt really remove makeup well at all I am a big fan of Sephora cleansing wipes so this was a big disappointment to me They are very rough and harsh Would be appropriate for cleaning my sink but not my skin The exfoliating side of this wipe is rough I found it to be incredibly scratchy and very uncomfortable to wipe on my face It felt like rubbing a jagged rock on my face even when I was using a super light touch and the wipe barely touched my skin The soft side of this wipe is much softer much more like a typical makeup remover  face wipe The wipe isnt very damp so I felt like it wasnt doing as great of a job cleaning my face Overall I was not impressed\\nread more These feel like wiping your face on concrete The one side is smooth but the other is too harsh The exfoliating side of the wipe is extremely rough and it hurt my face I dont even have sensitive skin and I didnt like the feeling The smooth side of the wipe is fine This is way too scratchy for the face Hurts to use The exfoliating side is very coarse it felt like I was cleaning my face with sand paper I dont have sensitive skin but I was afraid that it would tear the skin on my face The smooth cleansing side felt nice and would do a good job removing makeup I thought these charcoal detoxifying exfoliating wipes was to harsh for my face Which became a fast no way for me The exfoliating side is too rough and irritating on my skin I would have enjoyed them more if both sides were like the softer side Love the rougher side of these wipes but in the past two packages I received there was virtually no rough side Hope this is just with the two packages I received and not a permanent product change I have mixed feelings I believe this is a nice product to have for major build up and dead skin Maybe like a once a month deep cleaning The smell is light and pleasant The texture of the exfoliating side of the wipe is super rough Maybe a little too rough I really want to LOVE this product Its a great idea and hopefully it gets revamped These work fantastic are honestly better than expected The exfoliating side is effective and I think anyone could incorporate these into their exfoliation routine The DOWNSIDE is that the exfoliating sides is very rough so it was somewhat painful on my sensitive skin If you have normal skin this could work great If you have sensitive skin I recommend you look at something else In my case because I already have a pack I plan to use it once a week to exfoliate My plan is to be very gentle when scrubbing so I dont hurt my super sensitive skin\\nread more The exfoliating side of the wipe HURTS It scratches your face The smooth side isnt moist enough to effectively remove makeup Not even close to the previous formula This one doesnt wash off the make up stings the eyes and leaves residue Please bring the old cleanser back Did not like this facial cleanser It was recommended to me by a Sephora employee to buy this over another brand for taking makeup off It does not do its job and I feel as if my face is not actually getting clean from it It caused me to get acne on my cheeks which never happens to me It also claims to be a foaming cleanser and it definitely does not foam up Definitely not worth the price This product does not do a good job at cleaning the skin at all I have combination skin and my main concern is pores Awful smell and didnt do anything helpful for my face Please bring back the original formula I have used this for YEARS and Its not the same It does leave a weird film on your face I dont know what to buy or do now I really havent ever been so loyal to a cleanser I am sad now and am looking for something else I have most Sunday Riley products and love them but this and the foundation really disappointed me  Removes makeup including mascara Took off a star point because it can be slightly drying during winter months I just finished my bottle of this cleanser and based on the reviews here Ill probably go with another product This was an amazing cleanser and Im sorry to see it isnt anymore So bummed I used this cleanser for a few years and sang its praises for what it did for my large pores Now the new formula makes my skin feel dry and awful PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA This product is okay to use in the winter when you just want a pick me up but not for a daily cleanser Ive never used the old formula but this cleanser did a good job of cleaning my face It did however leave an odd film on my face I noticed that it made my face softer but Im not sure whats going on there The only thing I was not a fan of was the smell It was slightly earthy slightly moldy smelling Because of this I did not purchase again I tried this product in the gift set and wasnt impressed It didnt break out my sensitive skin but it also didnt really do anything positive I didnt feel refreshed or cleansed at all after using it I would not purchase this again Have to add to the chorus of reviews the original formula was my HG cleanser please bring it back I was devastated when they reformulated this cleanser Ceramic Clay Slip was my goto it was the best cleanser Id ever tried in my life and I repurchased it for years But once the Clay in Ceramic Slip got dropped it all went downhill The consistency feels much oilier now no longer refreshing and feels like a film sitting on top of your skin after washing off This new formula ended up breaking me out and I was so sad it was back to the drawing board to find a new HG cleanser This seems to be a pattern with Sunday Riley within the last year and the unfortunate thing is the company is not being forthright about the changes to their most famous formulas Good Genes being the biggest culpritnothing like it once was many longtime users agree and SR just denies it Its such a shame because the products seriously worked wonders But now not nearly as effective and the same high prices dont reflect the obvious changes If this was two years ago I wouldve enthusiastically recommended this cleanser without hesitation However as a longterm Sunday Riley consumer I unfortunately have to say this is a definite pass There are far better cleansers out there to spend your hard earned dollars on\\nread more I apparently missed out on the original formula which lived up to its name I received this with a Good Genes promo but since using it for about three weeks I can tell that my skin isnt as clean or smooth as when using say Banila  Co before my second step of cleansing with another soap I have had breakouts because of this which are weird for me I hate to add to the waste in the world and will either try to pawn this off on someone with hardy skin or squeeze it down the toilet then recycle to bottle\\nread more Although I initially liked this exfoliator it became too abrasive I like to exfoliate 34 times a week and this product is a little too harsh The formula has large granules that seem to tear the skin causing irritation and even pimples If you purchase this I would recommend using it no more than 2 times a week and try not to apply too much pressure to the skin when exfoliating It smella horrible I actually have to hold my breath to apply it Not what I expected at all Taking this back Denatured alcohol is the third ingredient Its 2020 Why are we still using this useless ingredient in skincare This helped my acne very much I recommend it It made my acne go away but now it is starting to come back  I was so excited to try this cleanser after sampling a few KIEHLS products I loved the fact it was daily use but also an exfoliating cleanser The truth is it doesnt completely remove your makeup even after 2 applications lathering  rinsing I always have concealer left around my eyes and I feel like it just pushes my foundation around my face You dont feel squeaky clean at all I was disappointed with this product being that its such a large bottle of it too and for the price point Buy yourself some Tatcha Deep cleanse if you want just that\\nread more This is a exfoliator It drives me crazy by how Kiehls says this is appropriate for twice a day usage This irritated my skin so badly using it twice a day but it helped my acne It left it scratched and raw for days This is good for a 2x a week usage I am giving it 2 stars since its good for acne but there is many better exfoliators than this I started using this product 3 days ago and saw results literally overnight I have used the Philosophy Purity Cleanser for the last 23 years and this product is definitely comparable Its extremely gentle and has managed to reduce the visibility of my acne scars Love the matching clay mask but I hate this wash It felt ineffective and didnt get along with my skin The mask in this line is fantastic though not sure why my skin likes it and not the cleanser since they share mostly the same ingredients Wasnt impressed by this for my clogged pores Will not be repurchasing While I did enjoy this product at first youll feel squeaky clean and baby smooth after your first try it is extremely drying and strips the skin with frequent use After a couple of uses this is marketed as a daily cleanser I started to notice how tight and dry my skin felt and Im as oily as can be Also the texture feels more like something youd put your skin through once a week as an exfoliating treatment not as a part of your daily cleansing routine However I wouldnt recommend physical exfoliators anyways just google microtears and maybe youll move onto chemical exfoliators like I did Try at your own risk but this product can definitely be rough on skin That combined with its price tag and possibly ruining your skin in the long run Id steer clear\\nread more After using this combo my skin dried out It wasnt extremely dry but it was tight and had to use a lot of moisture Absolutely worth it I use one in the morning and then the other at night and my skin is so smooth after using and doesnt feel dried out My husband even made a comment on how much he loved it  after ONE use Ive been using one of these these every night for about a month and like them more that I thought I would I use the juju less frequently because my skin has been dry but it is great for post micellar cleanse on the one or two days each week that I wear full makeup Since using them Ive been less prone to breaking out after wearing makeup My skin is combo oily nose and chin with dry neck and normal everywhere else The bars havent gone down much in size so I estimate them to last at least 6 months since I still use a foaming or gel wash in the morning Full size is a better value if you use only one formula and use it twice a day but I would rather have the small bars to get the variety and a fresh bar more often We have hard water and I found that these leave skin feeling surprisingly clean without any oily or talc type residues left behind When they run out I will repurchase Both bars fit together well in a travel soap dish\\nread more I desperately wanted to love these At 49 I still fight some acne and my skin is oily yet dry I found my cheeks burned a little bit after using both of these Now these little babies did make my face feel clean but it was short lived I felt I needed more moisturizer from the drying effect I have passed them to a friend hopefully they will get the love I wanted to give them These are tiny they dont lather very well not really hydrating 2 stars because its not the worse soap but its definitely not the best and even though its expensive its a good try me size They are high pH so they left my skin feeling tight and uncomfortable After about a week of use my skin broke out as bad as when I was a teenager I liked the ingredient list and admire the mission of the company but this is not a good product if you have sensitive skin or are acneprone I was so excited to try this and was greatly disappointed this product did horrible things to my skin The exfoliate bar did not do any exfoliating and both bars were so drying to my skin that no amount of moisturizer could make it better my skin felt tight and uncomfortable I also broke out days after I started using this will not purchase again I usually buy consonant natural foaming face wash and will be sticking with that from now on\\nread more This works My skintone is even I had tiny bumps they are gone The everyday soap is a little drying perfect for end of the day Using it twice really made my skin dry so definitely not gentle The combination really works Really wanted to love this but only after a few uses it dried out my skin terribly made it bumpy and irritated I have normal to dry skin and the exfoliating bar makes my skin peel a bit Worst product Ive ever used I used one week ago and my face is still SO dry and this product gave me under eye wrinkles Ive never had before Terribly disappointed and upset because my perfect skin is seemingly ruined it didnt make any difference compared to regular soaps I felt dove was better than this I purchased these after hearing friends rave about them I expected them to be amazing Theyre fine I cant say that they made any noticeable improvement to my skin which is combination nor did it make my skin worse in any way I couldnt dinstinguish between the Pekee or the Juju bar they both performed the same way They were completely fine but not something I would purchase again though Ive been more pleased by other products and just cant see what the hype is all about\\nread more Wanted to love these but they left my combooily skin squeaky clean and feeling stripped I used them consistently for several weeks and my skin broke out the worst it has in years Its granules are small and work well to polish the skin but it is hard to rinse off completely If I use it at my bathroom sink no matter how many times I rinse I always find some granules left on my skin afterwords So I have to use it under the shower head My face doesnt feel dry  it feels as if Ive already applied something It leaves your skin smooth because of the good polishing however it feels rather gooey and tacky which Im not crazy about It doesnt get rid of your make up so you must use it on a clean face I dont hate it but this isnt better than many others Ive used So I wont but it again\\nread more Used twice so far but usually thats when I know if I like something or not Its exfoliates my face quite well and it has a lovely smell You dont need much either which is good seeing as how its over 30 and its only a small little tube Not quite sure why the wooden piece is included because mine came off after only being in the shower for a few days Oh and its easy to squeeze out which is a must for me Pretty good exfoliator I wouldnt say holy grail status but it gets the job done Whenever I feel my face is looking dull or my pores are congested this is my go to for a really DEEP scrub But beware the granules may be small but if you scrub too hard you can definitely do some damage The wood cap fell off after a day or two of having this product The exfoliation is decent I use it once a week so it will probably last forever unlike the packaging Like it gentle and skin feels clean after use but dont think it does any deep cleaning or exfoliating so wont be buying again because didnt feel worth it After reading glowing reviews for this product I wanted to give it and its more gentle sister by Caudalie a try so got a sample from Sephora Ive only used this on my Tzone and while it seems to leave the pores on my nose looking clearer I find it a surprisingly harsh product to use Additionally it is REALLY hard to rinse off Even after copious rinsing I can still feel grains of the scrub on my face and have to use a warm face cloth and then more rinsing to get them all off I much prefer the Dr Brandt exfoliating scrub which I find more effective and very gentle for such an effective product\\nread more I was so excited for this product as it smells great and testing it on my hand in store was amazing But trying it at home the scrub was way harsh on my skin  those little beads just felt so rough At first I was not impressed I used this about 3 times once a week and did not notice a difference I really wanted to like this product so I was consistent even started to use it 23 times a week That is when I fell in love I have a lot of black headspores around my nose and chin area After using this product my blackheads are gone my skin in smooth and my pores are not nearly as noticeable The only thing i wish was different was the smell it isnt the best smelling product But it really does the job\\nread more Theyre fine Nothing special I thought micellar meant these would function as a cleansing wipe but they dont  at least no different from my tap water No real advantage but no real downside either except the wasted money The cloth is sturdy  soft no fragrance maybe if you react to just about everything these would be worth it for travel I have a hard time seeing the point though it seems no better to me than water  a paper towel which you can get most places\\nread more These are the most luxurious face wipes Ive ever tried They do a great job of removing makeup and theyre one of the few cloths Ive tried that dont leave any sort of sticky residue behind As in my face actually feels clean after using these cloths However theyre definitely not the best value and I only usually buy these for travel on international flights since theyre perfect for the plane I do however use the bottles of Spa Water at home\\nread more Being a big user of moisturizing and cleaning not impressed Bought on sale making 15 per package used for a trip Wipes required more than 2 for me to feel clean with toner spray and my facial serum Bought only for ingredients purposes for my sensitive skin I deal with a rare inflammation that sometimes affects my face these did not irritate at all Pricey I bought these wipes based off the numerous great reviews but it is not worth the money I bought these thinking one wipe would remove my full face of makeup but I have to use at least 3 I use Estée Lauder double wear foundation and Lancôme big mascara It does feel nicer on the skin than the drugstore brand and doesnt leave you feeling gross after But seeing as it cant even fully remove my non waterproof mascara I cant justify the price Definitely disappointed\\nread more Undoubtedly my favorite makeup removing wipes that Ive been using for years now Theyre a refreshing and gentle addition to the many steps in my cleansingbeauty regimen Doesnt exfoliate and doesnt cause breakouts However the prices seem to continuously inflate and occasionally the value packs run out of stock on Sephora which has led me to turn to competitors other stores who offer better prices or other brands of makeup removing wipes I absolutely will not be paying 72 for 40 wipes  59 for 30 wipes\\nread more Im torn between thinking these wipes are the most amazing way to remove makeup ever but then also thinking the price isnt worth me being lazy and skipping a few steps in my skincare routine The pluses are it does remove makeup easily and you only need a single wipe I wear loud eyeshadow that sometimes stains and these clean it right off But I cant justify purchasing them when for 7 I can purchase a huge bottle of Garnier Micellar Water and save back the extra cash for something really worth it like a new palette or to go towards a bomb hair styler\\nread more I thought I would use these for the foreseeable future I think Ive used them for at least a decadethey work great on busy and lazy days but this latest exorbitant price increase has me looking elsewhere I dont mind paying for quality but its getting ridiculous Maybe Ill be back or maybe Ill bite the bullet and properly wash my face more often Giving these 4 stars because they are a bit pricey but honestly such nice face wipes Ive tried Sephora brand Korres Neutrogena etc but I never feel like they really get all my make up off at the end of a long night These are thick and relatively large They are soothing on the skin and feel super refreshing I have sensitive acne prone skin and they are great for if I am too lazytired to wash my face or traveling The wipes themselves are nice but I cant recommend them unless you like relying on a product that gets more and more expensive every few months I understand that prices have to go up somewhat over time but in the past year continuous price hikes have made it so an already pricey item has now almost doubled in cost they used to be 13 not that long ago around this time last year they were 15 and now theyre up to 23 for ten cloths Im sad to say goodbye to them as I used to go out of my way to use them exclusively but no makeup wipes are good enough to justify throwing 230 in the trash every time I take off my makeup There are plenty of other luxe companies with more affordable\\nread more These are the best facial wipes I have ever used Ever They get every bit of makeup I have off This is including longwear makeup and waterproof mascara I dont know how it happens but when you pull a new one out of the package they are cool to the touch and very refreshing Im knocking off stars just for the fact that almost a year ago these were 13 I tried to justify spending 130 per wipe Theyve gone up 10 in a year 230 per wipe Im finding it really hard to justify buying these still If they go up anymore I wont I like the single packs best The larger more expensive pack has smaller cloths Other than the price these are fantastic and deserve five stars\\nread more I like these in the three pack because they seem better quality than the large pack which I have also bought I bought these for the days Im too tired to wash my face and they dont leave a gross residue That being said I wont buy these anymore because the price keeps going up so often that I feel like the company is just being greedy I dont think Ive seen a company raise their prices like this one These are nice but not a miracle since I still have to use two of them at a time Ive tried a lot of different face wipes from Sephora and elsewhere and I do like how these feel and clean the best My second favorite are Costco brand face wipes Im going to stick with Costco use cleansing water or put the effort into double cleansing with an oil and face wash Even though I can afford these the companys greedy increases are a turnoff\\nread more The price increase is outrageous In June the single pack was 17 and 3pack was 48 but now they are 23 and 59 Its unbelievable the prices has gone up over 30 and 20 in two months Wont be purchasing again Nice cleanser and works very well with Foreo Luna This cleanser will always have a place in my heart Its a perfect way to wash off after a sweaty AM workout My skin feels soft and revitalized after application Highly recommend If you have dry skin this isnt for youits to strong for dry skinit left my face with dry patches Personally I love Clinique however I am disappointed with this I have acne and very sensitive skin if this sound like you I do not recommend The cleanser did not truly clean my skin I still had dirt or foundation coming off on the towel also the exfoliation grit in side was nice for physical removal of dead skin but not for a daily uses and not if you are like me and have acne But I feel like this would be a great product if you just needed a weekly exfoliate \\nread more I love the way this face wash makes my skin feel  especially in the mornings Ive repurchased this twice now and I consider it my holy grail My only issue with this is that its hard to get the product out once it runs out about halfway The bottle fills up with air and because the cap is so big its hard to squeeze the product out I thought the bottle just ran out until I decided to cut it open and see how much was left inside just in case As you can see by the photo I was able to fill an entire travel size container with product that was left over inside\\nread more This was one of my favorites for awhile However it didnt really help my acne I love the exfoliation this gives Ive just moved onto other Clinique products Nice product Classic cant go wrong for all skin types in my opinion You can really can scrub your face with it and it leaves your skin so smooth Might be able to find a dupe for cheaper Horrible smell that seemed stronger once on you and then pretty bad and big breakouts  Clinique is usually pretty solid for sensitive skin but not this product on me I was soo happy when I first bought Clinique thinking it would be a great purchase but than my skin started breaking out so bad this is the worst my acne has ever been and Im so upset because I wanted to love these products Horrible Had a strong scent of alcohol which my mistake i did not smell until after i put it all over my face 15 minutes after i used it on my face I saw my skin starting to dry out and flake EVEN with moisturizer I tried to add more moisturizer and it did not work I have combination skin so I thought it would help Did exactly the opposite My skin is sensitive so do not recommend This Clinique Clarifying Lotion 3 is a very effective exfoliating toner that minimized my breakouts and completely eliminated any poreclogging oils and dead skin on my face It gave me a clearer complexion within a week and my skin absorbed my moisturizer much better as a result My only complaint is that this did sting my face a little while applying so I wouldnt recommend it for sensitive skin But overall I liked how easy it was to use and apply this product Plus the small deluxe sample bottle lasted me much longer than expected I am just now about to finish it after over a month of daily use so a little goes a long way with this Its a great value whether you buy it as part of their 3step system or decide to use it solo I recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable skincare routine especially because Clinique makes 3 other clarifying lotions depending on your skin type\\nread more I didnt like this product It dried out my skin and smelled like chemicals It didnt clear up my skin at all either Would not recommend VERY effective at removing dirt and oil from face I use this after I do a very deep clean with my Foreo Luna and Fresh Soy Facial Cleanser which takes of makeup very very well and I STILL find dirt and oil on my cotton pads when using this toner I have oily tzone and I dont find it drying at all However as effective as it is Im not a huge fan of the alcohol in it Once Im done with this bottle I am going to try to find another toner that is equally effective without the alcohol\\nread more Its a great toner Good for oily skin Exfoliates really well Downside is the alcohol Its denatured but the Smell is potent I really enjoy this refreshing toner thoroughly cleanses my combooily skin and help clears breakouts without over drying or breaking the bank I love this product but I was surprised it did not take off the mascara I had on the other day I thought it took everything off Although it is very nice and It is still my fav and will keep using it I saw tons of people recommended this said how nature it is for me it sure feels good on my faceBut every time it goes on my eyes it hurts I dont know if thiss only me I have no issue when I use Sephora wipes Especially with this price tag it should be better This product is great It does everything its suppose to be doing take off all the makeup eyeliner and mascara included not drying to the skin and do not really require a cleanser afterwards if you are feeling lazy not irritating to the skin feelings super nice and gentle usually I dont believe in expansive fancy products but this one changed my mind I love this product but I was surprised it did not take off the mascara I had on the other day I thought it took

to be doing take off all the makeup eyeliner and mascara included not drying to the skin and do not really require a cleanser afterwards if you are feeling lazy not irritating to the skin feelings super nice and gentle usually I dont believe in expansive fancy products but this one changed my mind I like that you can switch from a scrub to a mask not entirely sure if its working though I used this as both a scrub and a mask and nothing It didnt perform any better than my usual Boscia cleanser  in fact I think this performed worse in terms of oil control And I still have large clogged nose pores Im trying to get rid of This product did not work for me after using the entire bottle I have not seen any improvements in my blackheads I started by only using once daily for the first couple of days to make sure that my skin was okay with it I then moved on to using the product twice daily and using it as a 5 minute mask once a week After doing this consistently until I no longer had any more left my blackheads were unfortunately still there\\nread more Been using this product for a while now and I swear its making my face break out even more It doesnt clean blackheads like it claims to either my pores are still huge Plus it smells really strange and its has a liquid chalky feeling to it Dont buy Not only do I still have blackheads after using this product for a month I have been breaking out like never before My skin feels super oily and gross So disappointed in a product I hoped would really help Out of all of the Clinique cleansers this is probably my favorite I think it did help with my breakoutsblackheads The thing I didnt like about it was it smelled kind of like chemicals I like this IT leaves my skin feeling really clean I am not one to wash my face every day but in order to make the most of this product I committed to doing so Its fine as far as a face wash goes but I would not say that it will be your solution to blackheads I still have them In all of my problem areas My pores didnt shrink I dont have this amazing glowing skin It also really doesnt feel like a scrub It feels more like a moisturizer that you wash off Oh its also hard to get off your face So I guess I really didnt like it because I dont think it worked the way that it said it would Back to the drawing board for another product\\nread more Good cleanser Did not notice a difference in pores or blackheads It could just be that I got a bad batch but the sample I received was very runny This product did nothing for my skin that my regular face was doesnt do It just cleaned my face

in blackheads pores etc Glad I tried it before I purchased it Really wanted to love this because I love REN but I just couldnt I read reviews and saw that it left a residue I went with it anyway because Im super dry and sometimes that little bit of a residue is okay Turns out I was wrong It felt moisturizing but I just didnt feel clean at all It felt like I was just rubbing on wet moisturizer and then rinsing it off The smell was pretty strong too If it left me feeling clean it wouldve been totally okay with me but I actually had to return it Giving 2 stars because I hope it can at least be good for someone else wish I couldve loved it\\nread more I love the cleansing milk itself but the container is terrible I bought this twice The first time it would leak from the bottom and the second time it leaked from the top so I ended up losing half the liquid For the price I would expect better quality for the container I shouldnt have to replace with my own I got a sample of this and used it for a few days It felt greasyoilyeven for meand I have drydehydrated skin This causes my face to turn bright red and splotchy and is not good for sensitive skin The only reason I gave it 2 stars is my face didnt feel dry after I rinsed it off First of all it smells amazing Smells like I stuck my face in a lavender essential oil Very good for sensitive skinhavent seen a difference in my redness from dryness but I like that I can count on this cleanser to be gentle Ive been using this product for about a month and a half since I wanted to give my skin a chance to get used to it but it still hasnt really done anything for me I broke out on my forehead and have a lot of tiny bumps on it now This product felt more waxy than milky to me My cheeks are normally pink and my skin is very sensitive For the longest time I was looking for a product that would cool my face down but keep it smooth and soft Ive been using this product for almost 2 years and I dont think Ill ever switch my cleanser The only reason I rank it 45 stars is because the pump is finicky sometimes be careful not to pump out too much product It did not remove anything from my face and the worst part is it leaves an OILY FILM on my face after I use it Thats the opposite of a cleanser Wanted this to be my new favorite but after using it for about two weeks I started noticing little bumps or pimple under the skin on my forehead As soon as I switched back to my old cleanser the bumps went away Bummer It doesnt remove sunscreens nor Waterproof mascara Its good for a second cleanser I tired this product out and I feel like I wasted my money I have combination skin with oiliness in my Tzone and dry skin in my mouth area Every single time after I use this my dry skin gets so flaky and more dry I feel like it literally does nothing for my skin This wasnt bad in removing makeup but it broke my face out I wouldnt get it again Unlike others I have not experienced the wipes drying out I am on my last wipe and they all stayed moist I just made sure to seal the top every time I pulled a wipe out In my experience all of my makeup comes off it does leave a bit of a film on my face but it goes away quickly I notice when I wipe my mascara off it makes my vision go a little blurry so I try to wipe off my mascara with something else and then just use these on the rest of my face they seem very effective\\nread more I do not feel that this removed the makeup very well It made my face feel greasy and I still needed to use my regular face wash to get everything off I got these wipes as a recommendation from Sephora beauty advisor I told her that I need something oil free cause I have lash extensions and she recommended these They dont do really good job removing make up especially for the price offered have to use additional product to make it work well Okay yes these are drier than they should be But I love that they dont leave a heavy residue and truly clean my face pretty well you should still wash after using these though Honestly they remove my full face of makeup and eyeshadow and eyeliner and mascara with one wipe you just have to be smart about how you use it  I fold each wipe and use it a square at a time to maximize use of each inch They are overpriced But I havent found any wipes I prefer over this that dont make me breakout and that truly remove all my makeup\\nread more These wipes are so dry and hardly take off any of the makeup I wear throughout the day I have to use about two wipes to remove the entirety of my makeup from my whole face and even then after using the cleanser that I wipe off with face cloths I can see theres still SO much left over included a photo as reference its happened various times Youre better off just going with the basic drugstore makeup remover wipes\\nread more bought the wipes as the makeup remover balm is out of stock in stores did not like this my face becomes red after using two wipes The smell doesnt make me feel safe as well Definitely would not purchase again Not as calming as other Clinique products I love Clinique a lot but this is probably the worst product Ive used from them When I opened it the first wipe was very dry and then I figured I needed to go through a few By the time I reached the 10th wipe they were still extremely dry and could not take my eye makeup off They also are very thin and hard to pull out of the packaging These are good they do the job but they are really overpriced for what they are Theyre just wipesnot worth it These wipes are really good at removing make up for sure but I did find it irritated the sensitive skin around my eyes It also advertises no need for washing after I disagreeI felt like I needed to wash my face after Oily and greasy Does not work well at all I will return this and continue with the one I have always used Had to use two wipes just to get face makeup off Does not remove waterproof eye makeup like at all The wipes are very thin and dry Not as good as the original Take the Day Off balm Pretty good as a backup when washing your face with the original product is not possible The wipes are fine the price is fair but the dispenser is too large for the standard boxes and doesnt close properly Wipes dry out without a good seal This made me break out so much after about a month of using My skin texture remains the same Save your money and skip this product I have used Kiehls products forever and decided to try this based on the reviews It isnt sold in stores near me so I couldnt try a sample of it first so I decided to order it online It is ok I can see why people like it a lot but personally I think a Muslin cloth works better I didnt love it or hate it it was just an indifferent type of product for me and was nothing special about it to make me keep it It definitely smooths out my skin and makes my evening products glide on Doesnt irritate However it didnt help with reducing my pores size or help with oiliness This product is OK May be good for sensitive skin but it doesnt do much for mine I get better results with a chemical peel It feels nice on my skin but I give 4 stars because the scent is too strong for me For those whos not a bid fan of scent may not like it Will I buy it again I would say no because of the scent PS it smells nice just too strong to me Smells great feels luxurious I use it before my avene light moisturizer Or even right after using a spot treatment Ive been a long time user of the clinique clarifying lotions but gave this a try on my quest to find a alcoholfree toner Its alright It does feel very calming and soothing on the skin but thats about it It is heavily fragranced so if you are sensitive to fragrance and dyes I would stay away from this Bought this toner because it had great reviews I do like the soothing properties of the Camomile but I also noticed that my skin started to break out after using this product This product does remove all left over makeup after cleansing but something about this product doesnt sit well with my skin It was ok Definitely not one of the best toners ive tried The smell is way to strong and in my opinion it doesnt do anything for the skin except moisturize it I was pretty surprised to find that in an alcohol free toner two of the top ingredients are types of alcohol The scent is nice very herbal but I didnt find it hydrating at all I have very sensitive skin and although it didnt irritate it it did leave me with that tight dry feeling as though the alcohol pulled all the moisture out of my skin Im disappointed with the product because I was hoping for a hydrating toner Calming but the smell is too strong Im not repurchasing I love Tatcha and wanted to try another Japanese beauty brand for comparison I regret using my Beauty Insider points to get a kit with this brands products Alcohol is the 3rd ingredient so drying for the skin when an essence is supposed to enhance moisture I was SOOO looking forward to using this the reviews hyped my expectations a lot i bought it only too realize too late that the second ingredient is denatured alcohol which can be drying irritating and very damaging to the skin over time Very disappointed that a luxury brand would use such damaging ingredients If you are a women with normal strength you can not open this bottle The bottle designer must be a weight lifting champion and had only hisher teammates tested it I am at this moment sitting in my bedroom frustrated with broken skin on my hand after tried everything including my husband a pair of pliers burning with fire and my teeth I will never buy again unless they change the design Not worth it I am new to essences so I dont have anything to use to compare I use it as instructed after I cleanse my face before I put on serum and moisturizer It is very expensive and seems like a bit of a luxury But I like it Its beautiful on the shelf in the glass bottle It smells wonderful It goes on so smoothly and absorbs quickly I definitely will continue to use it not sure if I will buy it again although I hear it lasts a loooong time or try another essence\\nread more This essence was just okay The bottle is so pretty but its soooo impractical Terrible for travel and the top is just a stopper Skin does not appear nor revitalized after 30 days of use Expected more based on product claims it foams really nicely but it dried out my skin SO MUCH If you like the feeling and smell of washing your face with bar soap you will like this I got this as a free sample Maybe its just the bottle I got but it feels horrible after I rinse it off Makes my skin feel very tacky and sticky My skin has felt cleaner and more moisturized with drug store cleansers Ive been using this product for as long as I can remember I have incredibly sensitive eyes and I cannot use just anything because I wake up an allergic mess the next day I will usually use this AFTER my make up remover This doesnt quite do the job of removing make up But used with the Clinique cleansing balm or after the Farmacy balm it is perfect Is you have allergies to oils fragrance or dyes this is your go to\\nread more This leaves my skin squeaky clean and not in a good way Its hard to rinse it all off because my skin is so stripped And its not even that good at removing makeup I like more luxurious products that feel like theyre improving my skin as I use them This isnt one of those products I found this cleanser to be too harsh and drying for my skin I have dry skin and this just made my face feel awful after This would probably be good for someone with oily skin Gets the job done However even if a little bit gets into my eyes it hurts a lot Wont be using after finishing this tube This cleanser is alright Nothing special It cleans my face just fine but is a bit drying Better for oily skin Also be careful it stings my eyes really bad 3 stars meaning good but wouldnt buy again Leaves that squeaky clean feeling which I dont like and does not take off my makeup Giving it three stars because it does have a nice feel to I like the intense foam and a little goes a long way Being a fan of Shiseido I really wanted to fall in love with this cleansing foam but i ended up looking like I fell flat on my face instead The scent was nice and light and it definitely cleanses my face with a nice foamy application My issue was how my skin felt and look after using it I even tried to use it for more than a week or two in case my face needed some time to adjust but the more I used it the worse my skin became My cheeks began to develop these little bumps that I didnt get before I believe theyre called milia but Im not a dermatologist No I did not wear make up during the time I was testing out this cleanser Yes I exfoliate my skin and I wash my face thoroughly Unfortunately now I am stuck with a cleanser I barely used and will never use again AND my face is uglier than before I started using this product Thats two things Im never getting back my complexion and my money Before and after included no filters no edits\\nread more Honestly I still get amazed by how foamy this product can get Its really fun watching a pea sized product transform into a rich foamy lather As for the brightening effect I did notice my acne scars fainting but the effects really subtle despite using this product religiously for about a month now I am also a little concerned about how tight and dry my skin feels after using this product It makes my face feel like its stripped of all its natural oil which isnt a good thing It definitely works well as a cleanser but Im not sure how effective this cleanser is if its going to dry your face out every time you use it\\nread more Leaves my skin really dry and tight I have combination skin and this cleanser felt super drying It left my face squeaky clean which is a plus However I must moisturize soon after or else my face feels too tight That being said the light scent is super nice and it lathers into a rich foam and feels soooo luxurious I wanted to like this product so much but just cant It lathers nicely and has a pleasant smell It rubs in nicely but that is where the greatness ends When washing the product off it leaves the same sort of feel that a bar of soap has on the skin Very dry like and tight I like my skin to be soft and smooth after a wash not rough like This product works extremely well for cleaning my skin and really getting everything out The only thing is that it leaves my skin pretty dry however I do have dry skin to begin with Long as I moisturize right after its not an issue I thought it worked well It never dried out my face and it seemed to help brighten my complexion I WAS SO EXCITED THAT I FOUND A CLEANSER THAT LEFT MY SKIN FEELING SO HYDRATED BUT ONCE I LOOKED AT THE INGREDIENTS WAS DISAPPOINTED TO SEE IT HAS SULFATES WILL FINISH MY 15OZ GIFT BUT WONT BE PURCHASINGTOO BAD Not good I used it for a few months No difference in my face if anything it looks dryer I absolutely ADORE citrus smells and the smell of this cleanser is to DIE for Like grapefruit candy Other than that its a pretty basic cleanser  not too drying not too greasy leaves a little makeup behind for my toner to pick up  but I could smell this stuff all day long If youre a diehard fan of citrus it could be worth the splurge I got this product about 2 months ago and it has helped my skin so much Although when I got it I didnt know there was mandarin oranges in it so I was very confused about the smell of it but it is totally amazing I thought this cleanser was just ok I used the entire bottle and while my skin didnt get worse it didnt necessarily get any noticeably better It removed makeup pretty well and kept breakouts down but did nothing for the appearance of my pores or oiliness Also Im not sure why there are beads in it since they seem to disappear before they can actually exfoliate anything Would recommend to people with oily skin However after using it several days in a row it does dry out my skin But if i stick to three times a week my skin feels buoyant and amazing pretty good I got a sample and was attracted to it as I live in NYC and am exposed to filthy subway stations and pollution everyday and this is such a refreshing part of my day and leaves my face feeling clean and not dry Kind of drying on my face Love Murad but not this one This is a great product I dont need it every day Sometimes it seems after wearing makeup and even though I wash it off ever night my face just feels like it has extra oil ready and waiting to produce those pimples This takes care of that At least for me it does It will dry your face out if you use it too much I did not like this toner Dried my skin out and caused breakouts No thank you So far Ive been using this for three weeks and it feels great It has a freshness feeling which def a big plus I cant tell if it helped my pores yet but Im still using it just to see how it ends up and I cannot wait i dont know if im doing something wrong but for me this Product really buurrns and turns my face red it has also made me Breakout a lot Three is as high as I can go The bottle says its cooling and thats 100 true However it also burned my sensitive skin after three uses so Im going to take it back and keep researching Ive been using this toner for 5 days and twice a day My tzone area is very oily and I have tiny blackheads in that area as well This toner helped to reduce the appearance of the blackheads on my nose but it makes my skin slightly dry I will try to to use more moisturizer and see where that goes My face feels clean and fresh after using as step 2 in my skincare routine I had high expectations for this toner since I really like Murad but i have not seen any mayor improvements on my acne on the contrary I have experienced more oiliness and breakouts dont really want to attribute it to this toner but that what Ive noticed It has a strong smell and I can feel the alcohol on my face Will not purchase again Kind of drying on my face Love Murad but not this one This is a great product I dont need it every day

Love this Its amazing Makes my skin feel so clean However Im not happy that the price jumped from 24 to 29 in the matter of months I dont know if this is for guys but I got it as a free sample and I got 3 uses out of it It was the right amount of gritty for scrubbing my face gently and it smelled vegan if I may use that word It left my skin feeling clean which I like If you like those things then youll like this product Its pretty straightforward Im personally looking for something that makes me feel more special whether its helping me stop time on my face or works well with a clarisonic both things that this product doesnt do but still thats my honest review \\nread more I had decently clear skin before using this product never really broke out with blemishes but I thought Id use this product to clear up the close up black heads Ever since using this product my skin has been the worst its ever been and more noticeable in the areas where I most frequently apply this cleanser Really really good cleanser Its supposed to be for guys but it isnt rough on my skinin fact its exactly the type of nononsense nofuss gets the job done without bells and whistles cleanser that Ive been looking for I subtracted a star because the dispenser isnt the best design which makes it a bit wasteful and messy and its a tad bit drying but thats to be expected with a deep cleanser If its uncomfortable I dial it down to using this once per day only three times per weekno more\\nread more This product destroyed my skin I had a deluxe sample that I used semiregularly over a period of 2 weeks and was encouraged by the results Soft skin reduced blackheads etc didnt hesitate to order the full size When it arrived I upped my usage to 1x daily as recommended Considering the fact that I dont have sensitive skin and had been using the product already when my skin broke out into the most horrific fullface breakouts I have EVER had I looked to everything else as the potential culprit It took me almost two months to blame this cleanserparticularly since the breakouts got more or less intense depending on where I was in my cycle so I thought the issue could be more serioushormonal Nope I just get oilier at certain times and this deep dive made a point of accentuating that regularity With ridiculous numbers of whiteheads and honestly scabbyfeeling dry spots The long and the short of it is probably that I am not wellsuited to the glycolic acid and regular use dried the everliving heck out of my face I can accept that as my responsibility But holy heck be aware that this product can cause such a severe reaction because I wouldnt wish it on anyone\\nread more This is the fanciest thing I own Its lovely and I repurchased it because Im a sucker but its basically extremely expensive face spritz Its refreshing and smells like heaven but the ingredients list is nothing to really write home about and it makes your face a tiny bit sticky If you could buy jasmine flower water easily this would be a no brainer to make at home If youre not coming into money I would skip it This is a mist Its not a toner Yes it refreshes your face Otherwise its useless It smells nice though Overall Not worth it especially if you have acne prone skin Pick something else Im disappointed that this toner doesnt mix well with my skin I enjoyed this toner and repurchased this 3x but it causes my skin to get cystic acne I have combination skin with occasional cystic acne I didnt know what product was contributing to my cystic acne so as you would I took things out of my routine to see if my skin would react differently to the toner No changesI then alternated product I knew didnt irritate my skin or cause cystic acne I then found that this was the product that didnt work well for my skin This was causing my cysts I was so disappointed I wanted to like this product so bad but it wasnt benefiting my skin Bummer I enjoyed how this toner made my skin so soft plump and a spa like experience The texture of the product was lightweight and hydrating The best things has to be the smell of the product Its a spa like experience lightweight soft calming and definitely jasmine\\nread more I was really hoping this product would work for me since it has all clean ingredients but it actually made my eczema worse Every time I would use it I would end up with dry patches around my nostrils and on the creases of my eyes and ears Beware if you have sensitive skin The only reason it doesnt get 5 stars is the price Refreshing light and I even enjoyed the scent but over 50 for basically green tea scented witch hazel is a miss from me Although Herbivore is one of my favourite brands I cant say I wouldnt buy again though I purchased the Balance and Clarify set which contained a 2 oz container of this toner I typically spritz 2 pumps into my palms and pat into my skin after washing my face with warm water in the mornings I found this very enjoyable to use overall but I didnt notice any sort of results It restored some moisture after washing but that was about it It does have a distinct jasminefloral scent so Id avoid if you are sensitive to those fragrances I did really like the glass packaging though While I enjoyed using it I dont think its worth the price I recommend it if you are looking to splurge\\nread more Beautiful packaging and it smells great it helps with oil control but makes my face feel really dry after putting it on Like I feel like I need to rush to get a moisturizer on because its so uncomfortably dry and makes my face itchy I wanted to love it but my face says no  The smell isnt my favorite and takes some getting use to I got this as a gift and use here and there Definitely refreshing and soothing I use this before I put on any primer and makeup I dont think its worth the price Ive tried many things from the Herbivore line so far and this is my least favorite so far I am not really sensitive to smells but boy this stuff smells truly awful I really dont understand the reviews saying that it smells good and that makes me wonder if some batches of the product are turning bad I have to cover up the scent by putting on some Mario Badescu rose toner right after As far as balancingtoning benefits I havent noticed anything worth writing home about The 3 stars are for the clean ingredients and packaging\\nread more This toner smells great but made me break out with tiny pimples I think this toner is ONLY for people with acne If you have clear skin it just dries your skin out which then makes your face produce more oil which leads to said breakouts This made my skin so sticky and caused my face to heat up It was quite an uncomfortable feeling almost as if my skin was highly irritated Will not be repurchasing Hated this product It has a strong medicine odor and it dried my skin out It also seemed to do nothing for toningbalancing my skin It made my rosacea worseReturned it I would never have thought that a toner mist is what I needed in my regimen This completely and instantly balanced my skin tone I suffer with natural cheek redness and hydration who knew I was this dehydrated until using this The only reason Im giving it a star less is because the smell is a bit overwhelming in the beginning It reminds me of the red throat spray I used as a child to numb my throat when ill Nonetheless LOVE IT\\nread more I thought this would be a game changer in my skin care routine but unfortunately it just made me break out It made my rosacea and my acne worse The ole hendriksen green toner works much better for my acne prone skin and blackheadspores I like her fine but kind of the way that you like a coworker you have to put up with because you bought them before you did research  what am I saying Like they do a good job at work but they talk about their relationship too much and it just kinda bothers you This lady has squalene which I enjoy very much but it also has so many essential oils and some other things that I dont enjoy very much It doesnt emulsify up very well either I mean it does emulsify with some water added but its just not very satisfying My skin feels nice when I wash it off but I just wish the ingredients list was more simple Also like I thought this brand was supposed to be super natural and wholesome but after doing some research its not really Im currently trying to use more clean type products so would not repurchase\\nread more This cleansing oils really busts through makeup and daily grime It is the perfect start to my double cleansing process The smell is fantastic and that alone makes me excited to cleanse my face I really like that the oils easily emulsified when washed off not leaving a oily mess Does it moisturize Maybe but I wouldnt buy it specifically for that It is a gentle solution for removing makeup though which can help retain moisture in the skin I highly recommend following with a cleanser as this doesnt clean as deep and completely by itself in my opinion and that could explain some of the lower reviews this items has gotten Overall I would recommend\\nread more I love Kiehls products I use the midnight recovery oil and avocado eye cream  but this is not it i feel like it does not wash off properly and it burns if you get it in your eyes Product itself is fantastic Easy to use and really gentle on the skin Very good for removing makeup The bottle design is infuriating and causes the cleanser to leak out the top and dribble down the sides which functionally means that the bottle is covered in oil at all times I think I may just transfer the contents into a better dispensers as the cleanser itself is fantastic LUXURIOUS this oil is amazing for the first step in my double cleanse really takes everything off and smells so lovely must have in my routine I want to love this It works SO well it smells nice my makeup comes off with ease but it made my skin breakout I stopped using it let my skin clear up and tried again and I broke out again My work around is using it just on my eye makeup and not to remove the makeup on the rest of my face and that seemed to help It just clogged up my pores on my chin unfortunately Be aware if you are acne prone I wanted to like this product because it was recommended to me by an esthetician but it didnt work longterm for me It seemed to do a good job of removing makeup but there are some ingredients in there that did not agree with my skin I started getting an itchy red rash after a few days of using it nightly I know I know I should have patchtested first But I didnt So I returned it i thought i would like this a lot more than i did because i love Kiehls but it didnt take my makeup off really at all and i wasnt even wearing anything waterproof the amount of product i think i would have to use every night just isnt worth the price tbh i also have sensitive skin and it didnt fully break me out but it made my complexion more red than normal Bought this for my baby His skin feels super duper polished and looks more clear Hes now purchasing a bunch of products from this line I bought this for my husband who is the least product oriented person on earth and he loved it It purified his skin and kept his face looking fresh The only reason Im not giving this product five stars is because my hubs complained that the minty tingle was too intense for his liking Really good product overall I use it once or twice a week Main concern is it has a strong mint smell Mint is not good for your skin so I had to deduct a star I will continue using this because I dont wash with it daily and it doesnt stay on my skin for long but hopefully some day they will offer a milder scented version because the scrub is great these take off my face makeup really well and work fairly good for eye makeup too I have really sensitive skin I can never use any cleansers or makeup wipes because they always break me out But these have yet to disappoint I really like these wipes after youve wiped a couple of times around your eyes it hurts But they work well I had high expectations since I really like Philosophy products in general but this fell flat It doesnt remove regular regular mascara without a fight and leaves me feeling tacky in general after cleansing my face Ouch Rough on the skin I have since tried the Sephora rose cleansing wipes and its softer on my skin I just used the first wipe of the package It smells like it has fragrance added I dont really care for the scent AND I avoid fragrance on my skin as I have contact dermatitis off and on plus other sensitivities And even if I didnt it just doesnt seem to be a good idea to put fragrance on your face Anyway I checked the ingredients and dont see fragrance Not sure what this smell is but it doesnt work for me I love these wipes The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they were a little dry this time INGREDIENTS long list many plant oils which give a pleasant scent LARGE SIZE I cut these in halves which are sufficient for my whole face NOT FOR EYES as stated on the packaging do avoid the eye area because it will sting EFFECTIVE does a good job removing makeup More gentle than other wipes but still nothing so special about this I like these clothes in the morning when I dont have makeup on and want to quickly wash my face They are gentle and dont irritate my VERY sensitive skin The only thing I find is they are a bit dry so I just splash some water on it first before using I keep these with me to use after going to the gym in the mornings  wipe off all the sweat They work well and leave my face neck and decolletage feeling refreshed They are a good size and havent dried out even though I keep them in my car in summer in Atlanta sometimes Only four stars because Im not a fan of the smell and that is something philosophy usually nails Also the more sensitive skin on my face sometimes feels like there is a light film on it after using these Ill probably look for another wipe next time but I would reorder in a pinch\\nread more Didnt care for the scent at all and barely removed any makeup Rough on skin didnt cleanse that well not as good as Cetaphil cleaning wipes These wipes do not remove all make up I really hoped they would remove all traces of make up I have to use a toner after to get the rest off this cleanser is pretty good in the beginning my skin had a purging period tht didnt last long n cleared up pre quickly i love the lather it smells nice n fresh only couple cons is its abit drying and has a high price point for the amount u get I used this for about two weeks Now its true that every time I switch cleansers or facial soap I might get a whitehead or something as my skin adjusts But this is more than one or two This cleanser is actually irritating my skin and producing whiteheads some of which actually hurt Surprising because the first Boscia cleanser I ever used didnt do this I dont recommend this cleanser for sensitive skin So Im sending this back and I still have clogged nose pores to worry about Bummer\\nread more I was really excited to try this I have very oily skin I had been using dr Dennis gross alpha beta gel cleanser and I wanted to try something different The boscia left me with several dry patches which I never have and several blackheads on my nose and whiteheads on my cheeks and chin I used for approx 3 weeks My face was clear prior to using this cleanser Shouldnt have had a purge I returned and bought the alpha beta cleanser again yesterday Hopefully my face clears up soon\\nread more Although I havent seen much improvement in my ance this stuff has actually reduced the redness on my face immensely My skin tone is also way more even I would recommend I am crying right now as I am writing this thats how bad my skin has become since using this product I had about 2 pimples on my face when starting this product two weeks ago i now have over 20 Never in my life have I had this bad of acne Never I dont even know where to go from here I have never had this type of reaction to any cleanser Please ladies heed my warning stay far away from this cleanser It will RUIN your face\\nread more too gentle for me but smells really good i used it for about three months and my skin actually got worse luckily it did not dry out my skin but it did become extremely red Using this product twice a day now for a couple months and I have no complaints I havent been breaking out Its cleanses very well The only thing is it can be a bit drying so I have switched to a more hydrating moisturizer This is a pretty good cleanser My skin feels super clean and soft after I use it It is a bit drying but as long as you moisturize after its fine I really wanted to like this product after reading all the glowing reviews I gave it 2 months thinking I just needed to let my skin adjust I started breaking out with deep painful acne within a few days of using this product and have not had even close to clear skin since starting I find it leaves my skin feeling super dry after if I dont immediately follow it with a good moisturizer It does do a decent job of removing makeup but I can still get more off with a cleaning wipe after I have used this one\\nread more Ive been using this for 2 months now and I havent seen any difference in the amount of acne or blackheads I get which is a lot My skin does feel less oily though but that might just be because its winter Does not irritate my face but it doesnt clear my acne Excellent cleanser I have extremely reactive skin due to autoimmune issues so I am always nervous trying a new facial product I either get a rash or a major breakout and this little gem didnt cause me any problems at all I was previously using Lush coalface but they changed their formula so I had to seek out an alternative It was a happy accident because this is so much better on my sensitive skin I have been using the clear cpmplexion moisturizer for years and cant live without it If everything breaks you out this is worth a try Very nice foam and highly concentrated so you need very little product each time I do wish the bottle was transparent so you could see where your supply was I waited 30 days before writing this for a full skin turnover and im very happy with the results\\nread more It definitely makes your skin feel clean after washing but seems to overdry skin and does not help with the appearance or size of acne Wasnt the greatest cleanser didnt notice any difference in my skin Also maybe I received a defected bottle but the cleanser would leak frequently Read all the reviews so decided to go for it Used it consistently and it made my skin breakout even worse If you run the ingredients of this product through cosdna youll find it doesnt have any acnegenic or irritating agents which is great What it does have is sparkles Why does a cleanser have shimmer in it I have enough of that in my highlighters Im trying to get it off but the cleanser is adding its own I dont understand That aside it seems mild as a cleanser and I havent yet tried to remove makeup with it so I might update this review later I didnt find it drying yet\\nread more I was so excited to try this as I heard so many good things but I dont think it really did anything for my skin Ive been using for almost 2 months now great for oily skin and clears acne not a good cleanser for dry combination skin too stripping Im 28 and I have combination skin which gets dry in the winter time in Ohio but my tzone is always oily I gave this a shot instead of my trusty FAB gentle cleanser because I still get white heads and thought this would do the trick when I was younger I would get cystic acne pretty consistently with birth control and good skincare I managed to get them to stop despite the white heads around my nose and chin this brought out 5 cystic zits on my face Ive never had that many at once Im so upset not only do they hurt but theyre swollen and just look awful Im sure its going to leave scarring I switched back to the old cleanser and theyre clearing up again I cant say dont try this garbage because I have friends that swear by it This was just a big no for me\\nread more Not SHOOK but a great cleanser Mild I am sensitive to smells but I like this mild scent a lot Doesnt dry out my face I might try some other products from First Aid Beauty just to see if theyve got something else thatll really blow me away I would recommend if you have dry sensitive skin that sometimes breaks out a little I have congested combination sensitive skin Cleans well like gel red clay helps with removing oil but does not make skin super tight mild enough to use twice a day Must follow with mosturizer This is gentle on the skin but also cleanses very well My skin has definitely improved since I started using this cleanser Works great with my cleansing brush The product itself is good I really it working makes my pores smaller and skin more even Downside is packaging the silver paint comes off the cap during every use Ill returning it for this reason and hoping its just this bottle and not the entire line OK I expect more for this price point and brand I love some of the other products I first used this toner and a bottle down later was not so sure about using toners It did not do too much for my oily skin save make it a little more cleaner after face washing I switched to another that was almost half the price Murad with witch hazel and that really worked to clear and shrink my pores I dont think this is a bad product but not for my oily skin\\nread more The product is way to strong for my skin My skin broke out from using it in just two weeks It actually burns I would recommend it for someone with sensitive skin I returned it Third time buying this toner and it is far better than any other toner I have used Just okay but for me not worth repurchasing at this price Im over 34 of the way finished with the bottle and havent seen any improvement in my blackheads or dullness It does work as a nice general toner but no better than a average drug store version It was strong and effective but slightly harsh Ive been using this entire line for 4 months its ok but mot worth the money This REALLY irritated my skin red blotchy and lots of breakouts And at 40 a bottle Ouch A double whammy when I had to throw it away Needless to say I will NOT be purchasing this again Maybe itll be better for someone else If texture is an issue for you then meet your new toner It exfoliates without stripping or drying If you dont want a lot of serums scrubs etc than get this toner My only problem which is my skin not the product I had rash and this was a little much when my skin was more sensitive I was so excited to try this after a Sephora employee recommended it for my skin type however its difficult to get toner out via the pump Worst of all the silvery pump disintegrates and gets into the product Some of it got into my eye Havent seen a huge difference yet maybe my skins a little smoother i think you can get a toner just as good for less money not bad just ok I have been using this product for a couple of years now and was bummed when the formula bottle and size were changed but decided to give it a try I am on my second and final bottle of the changed formula It just didnt live up to its predecessor and price remained the same I can no longer recommend this product Smaller amount Weaker formula Wont purchase again I really want to like this product whole heartedlybut I think it may just not be for me I have combination skin and when I purchased this product I explained to the beauty rep that Im looking for something to tone and even out my skin tone Although my skin is significantly softer and hydrated it has become very oily and because of that I feel that this product has been making my skin break out As far as skin my skin tone evening outnot much of a difference Ive been using this product for 3 weeks now\\nread more I use this cleanser roughly once a week I have dry skin and even though this cleanser was surprisingly more gentle than I thought it would be if I use it too frequently it can make my skin even more dry It definitely cleans my skin and clears out my pores My face feels nice after I use it It works they way I need it to and I will definitely buy it again Oh and its a good size bottle I think the amount you get for the price is definitely worth it\\nread more Bought this product as a gentle exfoliator and Id say its doing its job largely I use it about 23x week at night otherwise if I use it more it can be really drying Didnt really see results re skin brightening and shedding away dullness hence my 4 star rating I have been overall pleased with this product in my experience Peter Thomas Roth delivers effective and noticeable results This product leaves my skin feeling renewed This was my cleanser for about a year It worked well in the first run but as I used it I noticed how drying this was to my oily skin It dried my skin out forcing me to use a moisturizer immediately I thought this would help my acne but there was no effect I would suggest a more soothing cleanser that is not as abrasive or drying I really like that a facewash Im pregnant and my skin is a mess this helped me keep my acne under control and made my skin look healthy and younger My only complaint is that it is a little drying so make sure to use a good moisturizer I love PTR but this cleanser seems to be quite simplistic and I dont see any improvements in my skin since I started using it three months ago I do like that the cleanser doesnt dry out my skin as my moisture barrier is being repaired Overall it is not worth the price imo Not good for dark spots not good to oily skin not effective against acne overly dried face Just not a good cleanser Purchased these because the store was all out of the Sephora brand I really like the packaging and the sheets come out 1 at a time which is really handy and keeps it organized The sheets work great and remove oil from my face The only thing I dont like is that they are scented not sure why as this doesnt benefit it at all so if you dont like scented things pass on them I use these daily on my combinationoily skin when I need to refresh my makeup These are not any better than other blotting sheets Ive used but the packaging is good it allows me to pull one sheet at a time and one sheet is enough for my entire face This brand is also at a better price point than some other brands Ive used I just wish it was frangrancefree I love Boscia blotting wipes  the green tea ones used to be my go to they dont stock them so I thought Id give these a try They smell really good and are pretty big BUT the do take off more makeup than the green tea ones 4 stars for cost  great bang for their buck smell and size of blotting paper and does get oil off 1 star off for also taking off make up I like that these blotting papers do not leave any powdery residue on my face and they are effective in blotting shine However the perfumelike scent is so strong that I could smell the unsealed but closed pack every time that I walked by my vanity table My eyes are sensitive to fragrance and these actually made my eyes water These sheets work as intended I got these because they dont have any added ingredients like mineral oil Good for soaking up excess facial oil and sweat One star off for the price but otherwise a great choice for us oily folks The sheets are nice and large they dont remove my makeup with the oil I am used to using the blue colours oil absorbing sheets from the drug store Compared to those the transparent colour of these makes the absorbed oil more difficult to see They do have a light pleasant scent It works ok not as good as other blotting papers i have used They are highly scented even though fragrance is NOT listed as an ingredient I might return but it is a lot of effort for one small product These also irritate my face unlike all other blotting papers I will switch back to the Sephora charcoal ones These also dont remove oil as well as others I used to have oily skin but my skin seems to be getting dryer as Im getting older and I noticed this dries out my skin even more Im surprised by its good reviews but its a miss for me Too harsh on my skin Ended up making me breakout I used it for a while too thinking my skin needed to get users to it but the moment I switched to another cleanser my skin improved Its also too perfumed Was not a fan of the smell The smell is disgusting Normal facial foaming cleanser tho Leaves face soft but it broke out and clogged my acne prone combination skin This is a great product for the value I find that it cleans the skins well I do use a balm before to remove makeup my skin has looked less red The only thing that would keep me from repurchasing is the smell it has a very strong scent which I dont find pleasant I have combo skin I donc really like this product I have a dry sensitive skin and this made me breakout I found it drying I found that the Clarins cleanser was too drying compared to the drugstore brand I was using I do have some dry patches around my nose and forehead but the rest of skin is oily It did a great job with removing the excess oil but my skin would feel tight and stripped of ALL my oil that Id have to overcompensate with my moisturizer It smells and feels exactly like using a bar of soap on your face Im going to be switching back to my drugstore brand because I feel like my skin is going to breakout soon  However I gave this product 3 stars because I am in the midst of winter now my skin becomes drier so Im going to revisit this product in the summer and see if it feels any better\\nread more Good product It feels like it cleans well Personally I like the texture how it foams up and the scent It does leave your face a bit dry after washing So you have to follow up with your toner and moisturizer The only con is the tube opening When you squeeze the tube you have to squeeze extra because of the tube design You really only need a pea size to clean your face Does not remove waterproof mascara A disappointment Do not buy if you use waterproof mascara You will find yourself rubbing much to hard to get all traces of mascara off Also stings eyes I find this is not the best eye makeup remover for me because I use a lot of waterproof mascaras I can see it being nice and nongreasy for normal mascaras Unfortunately I struggle every night to take off even half of my mascara with this one Especially with comparison to the Lancome eye makeup remover this is much less effective for me Very disppointed with this product I swear by their LASH DOUBLING MASCARA but the eye makeup remover I poured down the sink I went back to using the OILFREE NEUTROGENA eye makeup remover which is twice more efficient It doesnt remove all of my eye makeup and leaves behind smudges under my eye that I cant get off and you have to rinse it off with water afterwards I prefer Lancome but until they quit testing on animals I will continue my search for a cruelty free eye makeup remover Ok gets the job done Love this My mom has used this since I can remember and now I use it I use a balm to get all my makeup off before I cleanse but even after there is always some black mascara or liner that is left behind This so gently removes it Boom its gone And feels like nothing on the skin and doesnt irritate my very sensitive eyes Highly recommend Just awful If I couldve given no stars I would Sephora didnt have my best loved Nars eye makeup remover and I wanted an oil free one Thats about all it has got going for it as it stung my eyes and didnt even remove my eye makeup I bought this to replace Sephora nongreasy eye makeup remover I can not longer get discontinued It works well but Ive the added step of rinsing or Id give it 4 or 5 starts I havent tried it yet but hope I like it since I am used to the one in the purple bottle Not sure why I couldnt find the product I always use but then every time I go to try on or purchase a product I use and love it is never in stock Yes I can order online but sometimes I would like to try it first This has happened the last 3 times I have gone to a store Very disappointed These smell amazing which is why I continue to use them but mostly on the smooth side I find the rough side a bit too rough Maybe I have sensitive skin but it feels sharp and like it is scratching my face off I use the smooth side first and then only use the exfoliating side where there is visible dead skin It cleanses really well and takes off makeup I just wouldnt recommend it if you have sensitive skin\\nread more Love the smell of this makeup wipe I also like the idea of the duo soft I used to purchase the charcoal wipes and recently decided to give these ones a try Love the scent and I feel like it does a better job at refreshing my skin Not sure if it helps it to actually glow I havent noticed a difference Was a fun purchase Will be buying this scent over the charcoal ones and will alternate between this and the coconut Will be using this package for travel Ive tried a few of these wipes now my first purchase was Yuzu and I was super disappointed had to use multiple wipes to clean all my makeup off which is very minimal and still had to use a cleanser afterwards But I needed an extra 1000 for free shipping so I decided to purchase this particular one Papaya and to my surprise I was not completely disappointed it cleansed my face decent and left a nice fresh scent and has a great exfoliator to it\\nread more I bought this cleanser not knowing anything about the line first time I used it my skin felt great clean and soft I couldnt wait to use it the next day 3 days later after using it only at night my skin was so dry and flaky I had to stop using it I have combination acne prone skin Its more for oily skin in my opinion I love this product I feel like I have combo skin The areas around my nose and chin get oily and my cheeks are kind of dry This product doesnt over dry my skin and doesnt leave my skin feeling tight It does a good job of leaving my skin feeling clean and helps fight breakouts I only gave it 4 starts because it doesnt foam up at all I recently purchased this cleaner as I wanted to try out this brand I actually bought this a couple of days before my birthday so this was a huge disappointment when I tried it out I wouldnt consider myself to have sensitive skin so be careful if you are thinking of trying this product The product says to use daily which is what I did My face has broke out with bumps and is itching all over my face It looks like I have acne and never usually have issues with my skin It has been 4 days and the bumps have not gone down I stopped using this product 4 days ago I will be returning this product\\nread more badly broke out everywhere and it did not foam up at all worst product glamglow has ever made please dont waste your money on this product I bought this as a replacement for the mud to foam cleanser in the pump It is not the same and is disappointing compared to its predecessor I would use it after taking my makeup off with an oil cleanser and between the two my skin would feel amazing and I could see that the grime was literally knocked out of my pores Not the same results with this formula Its nothing special This product is great for oily skin I found that this helped clear most of the oil out every time I used this This can be also used for people with sensitive skin However I bought this product mainly to get rid of my acne it did not help that much I have been using this cleanser since 2017 I have changed every skincare product in my routine since then except for this product It is excellent at keeping my skin from breakouts when combined with a good moisturizer The reason I am rating this product three stars is that recently the packaging is deplorable I am unsure as to what they changed but the adhesive for the shiny silver cap is not strong enough and flakes of silver are coming off onto all my other skincare products shelves hands and even onto my face following a cleansing I use a silicone pad to exfoliate but the flakes transfer from my hands onto the pad I have never had an issue with this product until now This product could be improved by another dispensing mechanism other than a squeeze tube I am not a fan of this method of dispensing to begin with however I overlooked it due to the product itself being so excellent I may need to consider other cleanser options in the future if the packaging does not change\\nread more Although this product smells divine I found it to be very harsh on my skin My skin dried up and became itchy so I scratched it and it turned into a viscous cycle Not a product for me but if you have super oily skin I expect its quite good HORRIBLE smell It makes me want to throw up I literally gagged when using it I received as a sample in my box I was so excited about but I have to say after to use that I wont do it again My skin is very very dry now and tight you could see my open pores from some miles away I dont have sensitive skin I always find the good point in every product but I dont know what kind of reaction this made on me  Meh I am an avid user of the gel to foam cleansers and this one is just not my fave or worth the money The scent smells like black licorice which can be an issue for some people but I find the larger problem when looking back at some of my favorite foam cleansers Lancome Creme Radiance or my current obsession Bliss Triple Oxygen mask I use the product in the shower and find that there is little to no foam regardless of the amount of time trying to work it into a lather\\nread more This product was nice But I found that the charcoal or charcoal products in general give my skin texture This product felt very nice while on my skin but it didnt help me with smoothing This just isnt the one for me The product does what it says but definitely get the correct cleanser for your skin type I got the normal one but I should have bought the one for sensitive skin types as the normal one dries me out a bit However what took this down two whole stars was the packaging Wow The lid twists onand even tho I am very careful before Id used half the tube it cracked and would leak everywhere Had to transfer it into another container so I can use it up I have about 1oz left\\nread more Its alright honestly Second ingredient is sulfate so Im not incredibly shocked at how dry my skin felt after consistent use Im also not a huge fan of the packaging its just inconvenient to have to somehow put the lid back on with one hand because I just put cleanser on the other hand Its alright for taking off makeup but like I said meh A very gentle but effective cleanser Ive been using it everyday after The Polish and since the first time my skin feels amazing Soft hydrated and very clean Its a great endoftheday product as it removes eye makeup very well Also the scent is fantastic This cleanser rocks Alittle bit goes along way I used it with my Clarisonic I could feel the deep clean but it did not dry my skin out which I was extremely happy about A little goes a long way with the Cleanse Ive used it after the Polish and it cleans my skin leaving it refreshed without any dryness or tightness When used in combination with the Polish my face always feels silky smooth afterwards The Cleanse also works well on its own as a second cleanser This cleanser does a really good job of taking your make up off and making your skin feel clean and soft however you have to rinse a couple times it almost has like a lasting soapiness that doesnt come off like other cleanser ive used but this whole Lancer system is really great definitely worth a shot Solid cleanser Gentle and doesnt strip the moisture on your skin at all A little goes a long way which is nice Doesnt do much for makeup removal though so as i was using the system  i would take my makeup off first then polish then cleanse then nourish You should probably be using a separate makeup remover anyway but in a pinch i like a double duty cleanser I like it but do not love it Doesnt feel like it rinses off The exfoliating scrub feels cleaner when rinsed It works well if the consistency is your thing First couple of times using it my skin was super soft But after the first couple of times the bottom half of my face broke out in tiny little bumps Theyre not red but the texture of my skin feels very rough when it normally is very smooth I have combo skin with some acne I like the idea of a gentle daily scrub but this product is quite rough which I admit I like bc it feels like its doing its job but I dont recommend using everyday Maybe once or twice a week if skin permits I did not give a 1star bc honestly it is a really good scrub its just too potent for daily use\\nread more Light not Too coarse but gets the job done perfect before applying makeup I have only been using the scrub for a couple of weeks but I really like it It truly is gentle on the skin The one problem is sometimes I dont feel as exfoliated as I expect to afterwards but that may just be because Im so used to harsher exfoliants Really good product though and no heavy scent Great scrub Gentle enough to use everyday I used this in the summer when my skin had peeled from a sunburn It exfoliates nicely but does leave you dry This product smells great However I found it left a film sticky on my skin It broke me out in pimples and made my cheeks dry Not the product for me Give me an extra clean feeling I was having an issue with my make up I felt looking cakey and didnt know what to use to help my skin the Sephora employee suggested this product I think its helping I havent use very much of the bottle yet but Ive been pretty consistent about using it daily it is a little pricey and time will tell but I think I am seeing improvement this is my first shiseido product And Im looking forward to trying more It was a little too sticky for my taste but it did soften I just had to put some other product over it When this product first came out I could not believe how soft it made my skin feel as well as the wonder scent I still like the product but I cant say I love it I do not know if the formula has changed but it is not the same as it once was I still really love other Shiseido products and they are worth the money Was sad to see that this was not alcohol free Returned due to the alcohols drying effects Would be great for someone with normal or oily skin I told the salesperson I liked the Soy Face Cleanser but was open to trying something different for the winter My skin definitely feels soft after cleansing with the Soy Milk but I am not so sure of how clean it is I am not in love with it and wouldnt use it ever in the summer Cetaphill makes a better version of a gentle cleanser Felt nice and gentle while using but left my skin tight dry and flaky Not a good cleanser if you use a prescription retinoid I love fresh so I was excited to try this after reading the reviews However for the first time I was disappointed with the product This BARELY removed my makeup it only smeared it all over my face with 3 pumps I recommend taking your money to a different product if you want something that will actually cleanse your face and remove your makeup The reason I gave this a 1 out of 5 is because of the smell While the gentleness of this product is great its just hard to get over the weird spoiled milk smell of it I tried using it to take off my foundation and it didnt work at all its just kinda a flop especially for how much it costs I am giving it 2 starts because I think it did its job I used it in a skin care class and I thought I liked it and bought the full size But when i used it at home i did not like it To me it smelled horrible I am probably the only person in here complaining about the smell but it was bad I could not bare to put that in my face when i had to hold my breath to use it I returned it to the store very gentle great for winter when I need a little more hydration It doesnt do well at taking your makeup off But if you wear very minimal make up or just need a morning gentle cleanse Then this is your product I used 4 pumps and it seems to disappear quickly A little doesnt go a long way here Tried this as my Sephora was out of the traditional Soy Cleanser and while its okay its no where near comparable to the traditional Save your money on this and buy the other one instead This is a lame product I was going to buy soy face cleanser but I accidentally got this I thought it is like foam version cleanser but it is a MAKEUP REMOVER and absolutely does not remove my makeup I use doublewear foundation btw which is super thick I dont throw it away but it is honestly useless I am using it to clean my hand after doing makeup It works pretty well when the makeup has not been set otherwise beep\\nread more I use this as a multipurpose cleaner lazy AM or PM when Im not doublecleansing before the gym to wipe off makeup after the gym to wipe off sweat before heading home to the shower It does its job to clean off everything and the formula really goes a long way Sometimes I rinse it off and sometimes I dont and it doesnt seem to make a difference in terms of the effect on my skin I will say it takes a bit longer to dry up before applying a toner or essence afterwards compared to some other micellar waters but it is also more hydrating so you could use it as a standalone and not have your skin feel dry\\nread more I really enjoy using this micro water as part of my regimen I put a little bit on a cotton pad and use it to remove my makeup I then use a gentle face wash I swear by cetaphil daily facial cleaner not the gentle skin one that looks almost the same The ingredients in this formulation are far more natural and pure than the original I prefer less more natural ingredients myself I truly do not understand peoples aversion to rinsing their face Yes you should rinse after using this Korean skincare has it right with the twothree step cleansing First step removes makeup and oils and the second actually cleans your skin For goodness sake wash your face  water is your friend \\nread more I used to use this micro water every morning every nightI was obsessed However the formula has changed  its completely different The previous one had no smell  didnt leave a residue I never used to rinse it off but this one leaves a sticky soapy residue I guess if youre looking for a micro water and dont mind having to rinse it off this isnt the worst one but I liked the old formula so much better Wont be buying again super bummed\\nread more I guess Dr Jart reformulated a much loved formula and I totally get why people are upset because I get how sad it is when I really love something and its staple in my routine but its discontinued or changed forever But as someone who is totally new to this micro water I thought it was pretty decent in removing eye makeup and foundation compared to other micellar waters Ive tried like BioDerma or Caudalie This smells refreshing and citrusy I use this as the first step in my triple cleanse I like to wet two cotton pads with these and then gently push and hold up against my eyes The trick with micellar water is that if you hold down for 510 seconds it will start breaking down hard to wash off makeup Then swipe lightly all over face and proceed to oil cleanser and then foaminggel cleanser Basically I use micellar water to breakdown hard to wash off make up I use the oil cleanser to clear the foundation out of my pores and then I use foaminggel cleansers to actually wash my face I remember that once I started doing the korean beauty doubletriple cleanse I noticed a lot less inflammation and acne on my face I also use this with cotton pads when I wake up in the morning if I dont want to completely wash off all my skincare from the previous night but still want to clear my face from pillow and blanket particles I have no idea what the old formulation was like but I do think this has pretty clean ingredients The bottle is super annoying and finnicky though theres always a small amount that hangs around and squirts out whenever you try to put the cap back on\\nread more Completely changed the formula bottle and packaging on this Extremely dissatisfied This used to be AMAZING but this new formula is a disaster My skin doesnt break out but it does not clean throughly as the old one did Do not waste your money Go Purchase Diors Hydra Life Micellar No Rinse Cleanser instead Associate told me this would do the trick as my makeup remover was between this and the Tatcha oil which is  Ended up returning because it didnt remove the waterproof eyeliner  too much work Otherwise nice and refreshing I loved how this removed my makeup But for some reason I woke up the next day with a very irritatedinflamed and itchy chin Not sure what did it but maybe its the sea minerals or milk lipids in it If that comes from dairy gross I dont typically have sensitive skin so I would use it again if they took out whatever irritants are in it WARNING PRODUCT IS COMPLETELY REFORMULATED Ive been using the previous formula for 5 yearsthis new formula has more citrus oils NO fermented ingredients Loved the old formula which was unscented and moisturized my sensitive skin New formula makes my skin react badly  i hope they bring back the old formula My face feels fantastic after using this Some have commented on the fragrance I have never used the previous version but I find that I really like the floral smell its sort of like thayers rose petal toner I can see how some might feel their face feels sticky after I do as the bottle recommends and do a quick rinse with water after using then I pat dry My skin feels very moisturized after this and I no longer need to put on moisturizer after applying curology after this which is fantastic\\nread more I used to love this product It had no fragrance and left my face feeling squeaky clean The formula has changed and this last bottle I ordered smells citrusy and leaves my face feeling sticky Please bring back the old formula I prefer the previous formulation This one smells like bug repellent contains fruit and flower oils My face did not feel soft and clean after washing It felt like there was product left on my skin after it was dry Will To purchase again Not for sensitive skin It dries out the skin completely and cannot be used in the eye area so you cant remove all your make up with it I do not recommend this product I was sold this after an associate told me its great for sensitive skin and removes waterproof makeup I ended up with a big dry patch around my mouth and nose and it was as good at removing waterproof mascara as using just water Returned this I was looking to switch to an oil free cleanser because I felt like my usual cleaners were making my lash extensions fall out faster I have normal to combination skin with no real issues other than the occasional dryness This stuff has a very pleasant smell and a little really does go a long way but it unfortunately made me break out so I had to return it My skin works really well with oilbased cleansers and creams so it could just be that its not used to it I gave it a little over a week before I had to stop and go back to my regular product and my skin cleared back up It has great reviews I really wanted to love it \\nread more I really wanted to enjoy this product and like other reviews say its very concentrated so one tube will last quite awhile but it dries out my face way too much I cant fully enjoy all the benefits its supposed to give Take note if you have sensitive skin like mine really disappointed in this face wash You have to work really hard to get it to lather and the quality does not match up to the price Even though I have dry skin I prefer this one to the hydrating toner I dont see too much of a difference between the hydrating one and this one and I prefer the scent for this one Its a pretty solid toner option given the price I really love the fact that you can spray it on because its the best way to get full coverage without overdoing it While I dont dislike this toner I dont love it While it made my face feel fresh I found that my acne was aggravated almost immediately Its a shame because it smells great and makes my skin feel nice Being that I just turned 30 Ive noticed my skin changing Wanting to add hydration and brighten my skin for preventative measures I switched from Clarifying Toner to this I did see some improvements over a few days as far as tighter pores and brighter skin my problem was it wasnt cleaning my pores either Unlike Clarifying Toner that goes deep into your pores this one didnt penetrate my pores and I ended up breaking out Back to the Clarifying Toner for me\\nread more I did not feel like product did anything to help my skin It made my skin oily and made my pores look bigger It also has a chemical smell mixed with the citrus scent but it seemed to go away once it dried I absolutely love how this toner makes my skin feel It hydrates and brightens my skin every time Only downfall is the spray is a bit harsh and you have to sprat multiple times to get a full coverage But otherwise this is a favorite toner of mine the toner brightened up my skin but then made me breakout I ended up just wearing it at night because when I would use it during my normal make up routine I would have two new pimples next day which sucked because I was looking for a toner for acne prone skin I have dry sensitive skin and have some uneven skin tone due to hormonal acne I really wanted to love this toner but similar to other reviews this was too drying rather than moisturizing so I returned this is a great product I have oily and acne prone skin and this has helped me immensely by controlling the oil It has also helped brighten my face and it feels very refreshing and smells amazing loved it Nothing strictly against this product but I doubt Ill be repurchasing I do appreciate the large bottle but the price is a bit hefty considering I dont feel the toner does all that much for my skin The plus sides are that it smells nice and citrusy and does pick up the makeup left after my double cleanse Thats really all it does though I dont notice a brighter complexion or a change in the hydration of my skin Ah well still going to finish this bottle\\nread more Purchased this toner in November to help with my acne scarring and hyperpigmentation I have to save after almost 4 months of use and I have not seen any difference It smells nice and fresh and thats it no significant changes to my skin An associate at my local Sephora referred my to another product that I hope will do what this one didnt Not the greatest scent but it does the job This is an amazing toner for brightening I used this as my spring into summer routine and had good results Its such a nice citrus smell and citrus really lifts my mood so I would recommend it for that alone It doesnt dry out my face and I put a healthy amount on I have noticed a good change in my skin but Ive been using other new products and I dont think this spray is a big contributor Overall I will buy it again because its refreshing to spray on my face daily and will have it as more of a selfcare ritual I love love love la Mer but this broke me out on my forehead and jawline I think its too perfumed for my temperamental skin Sent back I love the smell of this its a very cooling cucumberseaweed scent Doesnt do much for my skin as far as clearing it up but its a nice face wash to use for daily cleansing Did not like it  Was difficult to wash off Too expensive for what it offers I got a sample of this bc I wanted to try it and I love the way it smell and it really does clean my face well and I think it may provide a more youthful appearance but its not worth 95 I normally use clinique face wash or the body shop eucalyptus face wash and they both work to clean impurities in my skin But this did deeply clean so maybe I will buy it Hmmmm I got a sample of La Mer Cleansing Gel and used it for about 2 weeks You really need just a small amount to make it foam and leather Thats the beautiful part about it The glass container costs 95 but there is lots of product and Im sure it would last me a year It perfectly cleanses my skin and removedxmake up I have also tried it with my Clarasonic Mia and it worked well On the negative side it smells like cheap shampoo and it can be pretty hard to wash it of your face I really feel like Im washing my face with hair shampoo or shower gel And after I finally wash it off my face feel very tight dry and I even have some redness I would advice not to use it with a face brush if you have drysensitive skin I also noticed my skin started peeling off too drying and I had to stop using this product If you have normaloily skin type this product could work for you\\nread more Good smelling thick texture which cleans well even taking my mascara off I have oily skin and still had some breakouts with this No dryness though Just finished the bottle and it lasted a year and four months with regular use Overall pretty good and minus the price and some breakouts So I tried this cleansing gel and personally I dont like it I feel like my skin seems kind of dry even though it it cleans well I just still feel like its makes my skin stiff I would not repurchase this again especially for the price Did not remove all of my makeup Made my face feel so dry and tight Not a fan of the smell or price tag While la mer at first seems pricy only a little gel is needed per use making it a very worthwhile purchase The smell of the sea is very soothing and it gently cleans and brightens the face however having sensitive skin I do not recommend using this more than once a day Nonetheless probably one of the best cleanser available on the market Nasty Smells like mens cologne Leaves a greasy sheen on my face Doesnt foam at all Just sits Doesnt remove the dirt and grime from the day I love other Caudalie products but not this one I guess this does an okay job removing makeup but it is way too irritating especially for eyes I didnt even use it to remove my eye makeup and it still irritated my eyes It must be the fragrance When are skincare companies going to understand we dont need the fragrance Going to have to return love the texture of this product but holy cow its fragranced it smells like my grandmas favorite kitchen cleaner haha which i actually like the smell of hopefully i will notice it less over time as i want to really love this product because the texture has just been great and it feels like it really hydrates my skin This is my first time using an oil cleanser and its just ok My main issue is that the consistency is like water and basically goes right thru my fingers I have to use many squirts just to get enough to feel like Im cleaning my face Id prefer something that is a little thicker consistency and not so watery Feels like Ive just put a layer lotion on my face instead of taking off the dirt and cleaning everything underneath I do use the toner afterward and theres always a ton of residue on the pads Probably not for me again It does feel nice in terms of not drying out my skin but I think I need something more cleansing than moisturizing this is the first cleansing milk ive tried it made my hand feel soft in the store so i got it i definitely prefer it over drugstore cleansers mainly because its easy to rinse off ive been using it for about a week and ive gotten three pimples since then make of that what you will I overall really liked this product its very hydrating it literally UNDOES some of my dry patches even better than exfoliation does I used to have oily skin that but as I get older it becomes more combination so I need a cleanser that will hydrate my skin without triggering my cystic acne and this product does that I think the price is reasonable because it lasts a long time the product going a long way due to its balmy texture Two important things you need to use a cleansing oilmakeup remover before using this product It is not strong enough to get the dirt and grime off your skin without a precleanse Also trying to scrub your face aggressively after using the product with only irritate your skin Wash it off as best you can and then go in with a toner to clean off the rest of the product The only real problem with this product is that the first time I locked the pump to travel with it I lost the ability to unlock it again so now I have to take the tube out to wipe it on my face which isnt sanitary If you want to travel with this product or dont use a precleanse youd probably want another cleanser but I thoroughly enjoy it and Id recommend it to people with combination or dry skin\\nread more Ouch I used to use this years ago and it was beautiful it was gentle and it was creamy and light and took my makeup off with zero irritation Well they must have reformulated it and added more chemicals and fragrances because it ruined my skin My skin has been sore for three days now  its just finally calming down Caudalie has some lovely products but they should really cut back on the unnecessary chemicals and fragrances in their products because most of us now days are hyper sensitive to harsh fragrances\\nread more The only good thing about this is the smell It does not cleanse well at all I actually need to go in with a second cleanser just to get my makeup off and actually feel like I have cl ew an skin Since Ive started using this cleaner I have noticed breakouts Wont be buying again Love This cleanser is really effective and does everything its supposed to It removes excess dirt and oil without being too strong or drying It feels really refreshing on my skin I instantly noticed any big differences in my complection Loving this Completely absorbs oil instantly while leaving a matte like effectalways in my bag Finally a blot sheet that does what it says it will Removes oil and leaves your face matte Absolutely love these The blotting paper does exactly what its supposed to do but I really miss the rose version Please bring them back Sephora The first time I used this I felt itchy all over my face but thinking it was due to something I ate I ignored it and gave it a break Then the second time I experienced a small breakout of red itchy spots on my forehead I gave it another break The third and final time I developed a red patch on my cheek after using this I think Im sensitive to the fragrance Its a nice smell but its just a bit much I think It feels and smells very luxurious BUT didnt give me the results I was hoping for for my extremely dry skin Felt like it made my skin extra bumpy and tacky I have tried the 24 hr hydrating serum and that one is amazing will definitely be going back to that im honestly really upset that i got this without looking at the ingredients first The product has alohol in it and its 3rd in the ingredients which means that it mostly contains alcohol which is not good for your skin i dont know how i missed that I realized after i started using it my face started breaking out pretty bad so im returning this Im really upset with how the heck im gonna get my skin back to what it was before \\nread more I love how this toner works but the only issue here is how strong the scent is Its very perfumey but I would probably buy this again Just wish they made one that was lighter scented or unscented Feels hydrating like the pyunkangyul toner I used previously Does have a scent but not overpowering Though I did seem to break out using this not terrible though Better than I expected Very happy with the rich texture Its helping me to keep moisture before I applied moisturizer Pros feels very luxurious and milky on application Cons my skin didnt like this I have normal to dry skin I think it was the fragrance that irritated and caused tiny bumps on my skin Disappointed because I really wanted to like this I think this product would be amazing without the fragrance i have normal to sensitive skin and im living in canada so the winter just dries out my skin so badly so when i knew that this toner that is actually an essence would give a boost of hydration to my skin i didnt think twice after the second try i started getting little bumps in places i literally never had and a lot of blackheads in my nose which i literally never really had so i immediately stopped using the product i give it two stars because i think it would be great for maybe other people with a different skin type like those who have really dry skin and that isnt sensitive but for the price and the fact that it isnt even a toner and that doesnt contain actually witch hazel which is actually a good thing after some research lol i think that belif could do better\\nread more I got the Belif witch hazel toner as I needed a gentle toner It smells wonderful and clean and feels lovely refreshing and hydrating on the face but I find the word toner to be a misnomer for this product This behaves much more like an essence  its a thick slightly viscous texture When I received the bottle I noticed the usage directions are different from whats on the Sephora site the site mentions traditional method of application ie using a cotton pad whereas the bottle just says to pat it into your face with your hands the way youd apply an essence So when I use it I dont feel like Im toning  I just feel like Im adding an extra layer of moisture before my other products which is not true purpose of a toner Disappointed as I feel the product is mismarketed  just call it a hydrating essence\\nread more I tried this hoping it would help get rid of the Malassezia tiny bumps I kept getting all over my forehead and some on my cheeks nose and chin This broke me out soooo bad  worse than any product Ive ever used My face is extra dry red and irritated now AND theres a million bumps all over If you want to try witch hazel proceed with caution this is so beyond sticky and does not even go onto your face from the cotton pad  like nothing ive ever used before This product made me breakout so bad The witch hazel irritate my face and so did the alcohol in this product I wouldnt recommend I bought this product because I thought it had witch hazel in it and I wanted the witch hazel for its soothing properties When I got home I looked at the list of ingredients There is no witch hazel in this product although the name of the product claims that it contains it I even looked up the scientificgenus name for witch hazel Hamamelis to see if it was listed in the ingredients It is not I specifically bought this product for the witch hazel I will be returning it tomorrow\\nread more Ive been using this toner for a little over a month and I have to say I like it a lot However I probably would prefer it for the winter time given its consistency and preferred application technique My skin definitely feels moisturized and soothed My only problem is that since I apply my morning skin care before I apply makeup Ive been doing this for years with no issue I all of a sudden have issues with splotchiness under my eyes with my concealerfoundation Therefore I do have to be careful about where to apply it often times just foregoing it altogether\\nread more Unfortunately this made no difference to my skin Its wet and hydrating when I pat it on my face but after leaving it on I dont feel a difference touching my skin again if i could rate it zero stars i would WHY are ingredients like denatured alcohol and lemon peel in products that claim to be clean Am i missing something This sucks i want to trust these ratings and they matter a lot to me And now i cant for a reason i may never know i hope this issue will be resolved I really wanted this product to work for me but after giving it a fair try for a week and half my oily skin had never been oilier I was having to wash my face more often because my face got SO oily SO fast Ive never experienced anything like that before I couldnt bear to use it any longer because I had never seen my skin so yucky looking Im sure Im the exception since most reviews are amazing and I only found 1 or 2 other people who wrote similar things to me but figured I would share my experience too\\nread more The second ingredient is alcohol You really shouldnt be putting that on your face It smells terrible and burns when you apply it My fault for not reading the indrediant list before buying I have been on the hunt for a toner that didnt dry out my skin or make me break out and is natural It has been a process to say the least I noticed a difference within a week my skin was visibly more clear The only reason for the four stars in the bottle A lot gets wasted when you dispense it Ive started to put it in a bottle I have for another product that uses a pump instead and its lasting much longer now Was disappointed with the Denatured alcohol and returned Denatured alcohol is drying longterm This product is not for those with combination skin On the oily parts of my skin I started to breakout so now I only use it outside of my T zone Overall it is a good toner but you need to experiment with your skin I like it I can definitely see improvement in my skin My skin looks more smooth  less oily I would definitely recommend Ive used this morning and night since I received it in the mail maybe 23 weeks ago I dont love it but I dont hate it It really does have that alcohol scent which I dont like It kind of stings my skin as well I havent seen a difference either Once Im done using this I wont repurchase The zero oil line from origins isnt my favorite As much as us oily men and women want to decrease the oil production in our skin this toner if anything doesnt help and really strips everything making your skin feel tight\\nread more Im not sure how I feel about this yet Ive been using it for a few months but have to noticed any drastic changes in my skin It does help a little with oil control and does clean my skin on application I dont feel like it does much to help my pores or purify my skin though I will say that I am happy that it doesnt try out my skin like some oil control toners I have combination skin and this was really harsh and drying When I used it my skin was so sensitive and dry afterwards I tried to return it but unfortunately after 30 days theres nothing they can do to help you It has a pleasant mildly medicinal smell to it I put mine in the fridge so when I apply it I get an extra sense of refreshment Ive been using it for about 2 years now and definitely notice a difference in my complexion if I miss a day Is it the best toner out there I cant say But it does a good job for the price Really nice toner I have dry cheeks and oily t zone and chin Lots of hormonal acne on my chin and jaw This helps to reduce irritation On my second bottle Good value for price point This product causes mild irritation for my skin as it contains Dipropylene Glycol as the second ingredient This ingredient often cause irritation for sensitive skin people so I would only recommend it to people without any skin allergies Ive really enjoyed this toner I LOVE aqua bomb and had to dive into some more belif products This toner is really helping my hormonal acne flair ups Im also really enjoying the smell I live and stand by the belief aqua bomb and and the troubled skin face wash they have dramatically reduced my breakouts and when I do breakout they are small When I introduced this my skin went wild Pimples everywhere Im sure not everyone will have this problem but this was a for sure no Returned to the store Been using this product and so far havent broke out Gentle enough for me I really like this  Does not burn my face or any open pimples  And keeps my face clear  Really enjoying so far Do you really need a toner I purchased this because its a beauty rule Cleanse Tone Serum and Moisturize For many years I was yoyoing with different types of toners because its supposively essentials for acne prone and oily skins From Proactive to Clinique toners even Lancome It just doesnt work It makes my skin rough and drying and thus breakouts I hated toners I wanted to give it another try and maybe this Belif Toner will give better skin results because of the fewer harse ingredients Unfortunately no significant result I finally ran out last week and been thinking to purchase another type of toner But looking back my skin feels much smoother and hydrated WITHOUT it Toner is not necessary and could probably do harm than good for acne skins Im finally giving up on toners It DOES NOT WORK Our skin naturally hydrates and returns to neutral pH level after 15 minutes of washing our face Toning is useless My new basic rule Cleanse Eye Cream Serum Moisturizers and Protect Thats all you need Dont waste your time and money on 11 different products layering on top of each one Stop all the BS\\nread more it works good the fragrance is very clean and fresh I think this toner is just for normal use it can not heal the acne I bought this early last year and it said nothing about castor oil My skin cleared with a sample so I bought it Two or three bottles later my skin was breaking out I look at the box and castor oil is in the ingredients now What Nope Returned and switched brands Nice toner but didnt help with my acne Maybe even made it worse Very gentle and kind to skin though I really wanted to love this product BUT it didnt really help do anything to my skin besides make it feel fresh and smell really good but didnt help the actual appearance of my skin If you have acne thats persistent and can be cystic get the orange one instead Youre welcome This isnt for me I guess I LOVE PTR products absolutely some of the best in the market but for me this face wash hasnt done anything I expected I have adult hormonal acne and I thought this product would help prevent or calm down some of it but it hasnt The quantity for the price is amazing and the cleanliness of this product is amazing When I use my clarifying lotion afterwards theres no missed grime left on my fasts which I love but I unfortunately it hasnt helped control my acne I wont return Ill continue to use it until its gone then Ill try another one of their similar products\\nread more Love this product but the bottle is terrible It has opened up and spilled inside my travel kit countless times ruining everything inside including my bathroom bag Wish they would make an alternative bottle because the product is great but I wont use it due to the impractically engineered bottle when i first started using this product it was great my skin already showed signs of clearing after about two days of usage and it was easy to manage into my daily schedule however after about a weeks usage with the product dry flakes appeared beside my nose and eyes and though they were hardly noticeable it irritated my skin in those spots while i do recommend the product for clearing skin with bad acne issues i would say a hydrating moisturizer is very much needed with it or the same problems for future buyers might occur\\nread more WOW So recently since summer started Ive gotten really bad acne My face was just covered in big pimples and redness then I came across this acne started kit at sephora which included this tiny version clearing wash Within a week I already saw inprovement This stuff really helped clear up my skin My acne hasnt gone away completely but I can see it already going away I will say though I didnt use it for one day and I broke out bad So I believe you have to use this every day to see results\\nread more I have Combo VERY sensitive acne prone skin This stuff doesnt give me a crazy flare up like most products do and seriously gets rid of my blemishes The only reason why i rate a 4 and not a 5 is because it can be a bit drying Great for anyone with oily skin but if you are normal or combo just make sure you have a good moisturizer But its great it will get rid of big blemishes in about 2 days and i will see a serious decrease in redness and size within a few hours of using this\\nread more I bought this product twice because it seemed to get the job done Using this on my skin did not stop my breakouts but it did help control them in some way A downfall was that this product was a bit drying on my skin Purchased this product specifically for acne My acne has stayed the same now I dont know if its just me or the product but it did not help me out with my acne and I was desperately hoping it would given the price of this product Maybe itll work for others but personally didnt work out for me I think this is a good product It took about a week for it to really work its magic but my skin has cleared substantially and looks more even and vibrant Im giving it 4 stars because of the time it takes to see results If you have acne thats persistent and can

4 stars because of the time it takes to see results I wanted to buy oil blotting sheets for my purse so I went ahead and bought some here and after using them since June I can say I am not a fan In my opinion they make your skin feel like there is all kinds of dirt on your face after you use them I love blotting papers Ive had some version of them in my arsenal since junior high Im now 36 Ive battled oily skin since puberty and although now I have pretty much conquered that beast I keep these little helpers in every purse I have for the occasional shine in the Tzone or for when Im sweating a lot while wearing makeup I dont ever notice any kind of benefit from the various colors each has its own active ingredient ie charcoal green tea etc so for that I subtracted a star I pick which I get based on my mood while in storelol I often use both front and back of each sheet until Im satisfied that Ive blotted away the shine or sweat without messing up my makeup In this Texas heat that means about four sheets in the middle of the day\\nread more Im very underwhelmed by these The packaging is clumsy  they could have put the pickup sticker on the part that folds open instead of making an extra flap with a sticker on the back  Ive ripped sheets trying to maneuver them out of the package Theyre smaller than most blotting sheets that Ive used so I have to use more of them They are thicker sheets compared to others and my makeup comes off on the papers so I definitely wont be repurchasing for that specific reason Also they smell strange a little bit vinegary These just really disappointed me\\nread more I have extremely oily skin I tried these on a whim How bad could blotting papers be right You might as well use an actual piece of regular paper I literally have to mush them hard on my skin to pick up oil and my skin is OILY Never again The sheets themselves arent badthey soak up excess oil but they almost feel like bday tissue paper was cut up The packaging idea with the little sticky tab to pull out the sheet was a cool ideaBUT it stopped working after only a few days causing me to have to separate the top sheet with my fingers I pulled out more than 1 at a time trying to get these out after the sticker stopped working ANNOYING and a waste The boscia packaging is a better idea IMO\\nread more Works great at absorbing oil but I did bot like the shimmerglitter it leaves on my face This is a great basic cleanser I use topical tretinoin and clindamycin and I had to irritation or side effects I have dry sensitive skinand this cleanser is gentle didnt make my skin itch cleans pretty well but makes my skin very dry like the Sahara desert Strips the moisture out of my skin The texture and scent are great but sadly thats about it This cleanser really strips your skin and leaves mine feeling very tight and squeaky clean which isnt supposed to happen Disappointed  Not sure why Sephora did not approve my last review but I figured if Id try again This product was absolutely terrible for my eczema pronesensitive skin I shouldve paid attention to the ingredients list rather than trusting the clean stamp label There are a lot of very abrasive essential oils that severely dried out my skin giving me the worst eczema flare up Ive ever had I only used this product about 23 times per week and after a balm remover that Ive been using for years I hope this review goes through to save others with sensitive skin from the pain\\nread more Love the creamy texture and smell Like soft lemon But I felt it didnt take makeup off and left a weird film on my skin Its a nice cleanser It is a little thick which isnt my favorite but works nicely I bought this because it said it was gentle and there are lots of positive reviews I thought it lathered well and washed off most of my makeup My black liquid eyeliner that isnt waterproof took much more scrubbing to get off It felt tight that my skin felt stripped I dont have sensitive skin but dry and sometimes in the winter get small dry patches under my eyes Using this made my skin feel so dry I used my usual lotion and I felt burning After about an hour I started to feel some itching It wasnt an allergic reaction more like the product was harsh The smell isnt great either The next day I had some red rashy areas I never had an issue with acne or breakouts not even as a teenager Needless to say its in a box going back\\nread more I never write reviews but this product broke my skin out and I never struggle with acne It also gave my skin a squeaky feeling along with my hands after rinsing Not the squeaky clean feeling it felt more oily like it hadnt even washed my face at all Really wanted to love this product but Im going to trash it and go back to philosophy purity made simple cleanser Great gentle cleanser I got this to try out since I was looking for something gentle on my hormonal acne prone skin and I love Korean skincare so I figured why not try this The ingredients were appealing and as it turns out this was a great cleanser My skin always felt clean but not stripped after washing my face and it didnt irritate my sensitive skin The only problem I have with this cleanser and this may just be a personal issue but my skin because very oily after I use it I would wash and follow with my regular skincare routine but I would end up looking so greasy the next morning when I wake up or throughout the whole day It is possible that this formula was working against me and removing my natural oils as well when i used it but like I said it was not stripping It just didnt work for me\\nread more Very gentle cleanser I wanted to try different cleansers to see what would work best with my skin I use full coverage makeup with setting spray afterwards Cleanser doesnt seem to remove all the foundation the first time usually have to use it twice in order to ensure my makeup is all off This has a pH of 9 and it left my skin way too squeaky clean My skin felt stripped and tight which is never a good sign Ive been using this product on and off but still I can feel a weight off my face One thing I dont like about this product is that it leaves my face feeling like rubber I immediately need to moisturize it with something after applying it which is ok Gave me bad breakout after the first use  I decided to give it more try and continue using it for a month or so  it only got worse Gave it to my boyfriend and caused breakout on his skin as well Really wanted to love this product but I wont recommend it This cleanser cleans well and smells great but it unfortunately leaves my skin feeling very dry For that reason I would not repurchase it but I can see others enjoying this product Another plus for me is that it did not cause my sensitive skin to break out as other products often do I just wish it wasnt so drying This is cleanser is kind to my problematic sensitive skin I have acne prone combo skin It does not irritate and performs well This was just OK Did not break me out and my face was clean after use but it left my face feeling tight and stripped of moisture Not worth the price to me Great product Smells like lemons when its on the face Just be aware it will not take all your makeup off Its more for a clean face to be applied I havent breaked out after using this product so i will give it 4 stars because it doesnt take all of my makeup  A little goes a long way Love the pink packaging so cute Love this product but the bottle needs a redsigns Out of 6 bottles Ive purchased 4 leak when pumed from under the silver pump screw cap And its really messy to take back Requires an extra thread in my opinion I bought this yesterday with the understanding that it would be great for my sensitive dry skin However after only using it for 2 days I already know it has to go right back to the store After washing with it last night my face became quite irritated and dry I had to rewash with Cerave Hydrating cleanser to calm my skin down I thought maybe it was just a fluke and decided to try again today Same thing happened only tonight the irritation was worse and my face felt quite itchy I had high hopes for this product it has a great list of ingredients and am disappointed it didnt work out for me\\nread more I have very acneprone skin After starting to use a RetinA for my acne my face dried out like crazy and makeup remover wipes only exacerbated the problem This cleansing oil has totally saved me It removes almost ALL of my makeup while keeping my skin hydrated And it doesnt break me out The only problem Ive been having is that I have a hard time removing all of my mascara with this However Ive been too pleased with the overall effect of this product to get too fussed about that small detail\\nread more This is step one in my double cleansing process I have been using it for about two weeks now I bought it as I was in the market for something to take off my full face makeup especially the stubborn mascara I sampled it along with a couple other products too faced melt off and boscia make up break up before ultimately deciding on this product Although it seems like a big investment due to the price its totally worth it since I am using less makeup removing wipes now which were very irritating for my skin Per the directions I only use a few tiny pumps of product each use and thats enough to get the job done Leaves skin makeup free and feeling super soft\\nread more This does the job smells earthy and natural Its a little thin in consistency so can slip through your fingers while applying it to your skin Easily removes all makeup and rinses leaving clean soft skin with no residue or oily feel I like it but for the price I dont love it enough to repurchase I was not super impressed with this It just was kind of basic in every way Bought these when they were on sale They are great for traveling We got stuck in the airport overnight my face wash was in my checked back at our destination Having these in my carryon was so nice I like having a scrubbier side and a smooth side Gives you the option of how much if any exfoliating you want Being individually wrapped keeps them sanitary and convenient I use one or two a week for exfoliating when traveling When you travel a lotthese take up such a tiny amount of space and I dont have to have it in the liquid bag\\nread more I read so many glowing reviews for this product it really got my hopes up Shortly after I started using this product my skin became very dry and flaky This has happened before for a variety of reasons so I thought maybe it was weatherseasonal allergy related or another recent product irritating my skin I stopped using it and a few other products and my skin went back to normal within a few days I have since tested this product twice more without adding or removing any other products to my routine and each time within 2 days my skin again became very dry and flaky Each time I took a break from the product my skin was back to normal within a few days Effects are consistent whether the product is used once per day or once every other day indicating to me that either this product is too harsh for sensitive skin or possibly I am allergic to an ingredient in the product I rarely review my beauty purchases but in this case I feel the need to warn those with sensitive skin to exercise caution with this product\\nread more I dont have particularly sensitive skin but even just using the smooth side of this cloth my skin burns Must be the formula It does take off all my makeup altho takes some serious effort on eye liner and mascara causing more irritation Just not worth it I will be returning it sadly Amazing product to smooth and cleanse skin quickly and on the go I love them so much they have changed my skin and really do make my face glow I purchased two boxes of these and leave some in my purse for after the gym or if I am out on a hot day and my face feels oily These wipes made my break out and as a result I returned these I will say that these wipes are very good at cleaning akin and removing makeup As well the wipe is quite large and you can probably get away with only using half a wipe Had I not broken out badly I would have continued using these Decent as a makeup remover but the exfoliation left a lot to be desired And it left a bit of a weird residue Overall just ok Dont love it dont hate it I find this very gentle and a little goes a long way so it lasts a long time I was very disappointed I normally use makeup wipes for my face and wanted something gentle to remove my eye makeup Clinique is reputable and this product is even called a naturally GENTLE eye makeup remover Be warned it does NOT remove mascara gently Its THICK and feels extremely heavy when you put it on your eyes and you even have to scrub vigorously to remove your eye makeup Wouldnt recommend Try another product\\nread more This has to be rubbed on a dry eye and tissued off That is too much friction for the eye area I was looking for an eye makeup remover like Estée Lauder or Clinique Disappointed and wishing I had returned this This remover was actually very irritating to my eyes But Ive found that it does a great job at taking off lip stainslipstick without irritating my lips so not so bad This product doesnt work It will remove the makeup from skin but not eyelashes This did not work to take my makeup off a lot Was dissapointed based on others reviews Perhaps my makeup is just really hard to get off but I have never been able to find anything to do it really well I have to do the double cleansing method It was gentle but did not work to remove Ive tried quite a few eye makeup removers and I keep going back to this one The oily removers leave a residue for me and the ones labeled oilfree dont seem to work as well This guy gets my makeup off and comes off clean It takes off my eye shadow primer and waterproof mascara It does take 23 passes to get it all off but thats standard with every eye makeup remover Ive ever used Oh and the price point is excellent This bottle lasts me 68 months\\nread more I found that this did not work for me It did not remove my eyeliner and felt thick and goopy This went back This product melts mascara but is oily leaving the oily mascara residue at the roots of your lashes This soap makes my skin so smooth its insane I bought it to help with my blackheads though and it did absolutely nothing to clear them or any other blemishes up I also wish that the smell would stay on my skin longer It does last a while too I think this soap is great and helps with acne but it is drying so I have to moisturize really good if I use it on my face I prefer to use this on the body Broke me out I also got whiteheads and cystic type acne and it is still taking me months to get my skin to recover and I never had acne beforeplease dont use this product or patch test it Ive been using this soap 1x per day on my cystic sensitive skin Its really started to dry out my acne Its been a slow process for my skin in particular Which is why Im only giving it 4 stars But because my acne is hormonal I think its a little tougher to clear up Has a nice lather and leaves my skin feeling clean It is soap That cost 12 Call me a fool Save your money It also made my husband who has sensitive skin break out into a rash A nice light clarifying product It doesnt leave my skin feeling dried out and seems to help keep imperfections at bay Extremely messy You know going into it that a charcoal body product will be messy but this one goes above and beyond that With a quick drying hard to scrub off formula I use this soap bar for my body in the shower as I do get acne breakouts on my chest and back from time to time It does seem to keep them at bay and my skin feels very clean after I use it I will say it gives that tight squeaky feeling though so I wouldnt recommend using it on your face if you have dry skin Half star off for that While its a good bargain at 12 I really wish it lasted longer I find myself having to buy a bar more often than Id like so another half star off for that If you use it in the shower like I do I recommend keeping it inside a container so that it keeps a little longer\\nread more Have used as a face and body bar about a month and it has definitely cleared up my blackheads Still a little drying for winter months but it is charcoal so expected Ive heard a lot about charcoal and how it can help with acne I thought Id give it a try for 12 Let me start by saying Ive acne for over 10 years have tried everything including accutane x 2 and my acne came back Personally this soap didnt seem to help with my acne I also dont think it made it worse The soap wasnt particularly drying but it might be for those with dry or extra dry skin I use this nightly and this is a great end to my daily skin care routine It is gentle but can be a little drying as well I have combination skin I havent noticed a huge difference in my skin but overall my face is different Totally worth the 12 and is a good product Too expensive Ive tried many other charcoal cold process soap bars and they all work just as well as this for half the price I can buy 68oz bars for 7 from local markets and even grocery stores that work as well if not better 4oz for 12  shipping from Sephora is a huge margin you shouldnt be paying for I used the entire bar up on my faceback for acne It leaves a very slimy texture possibly due to excessively hard water and takes a while to wash all the residue off 2 stars for the price 3 stars for a soap doing what any other soap does\\nread more This didnt really do anything for my breakouts but it didnt dry me out which is nice I ended up using the rest of the bar for my body instead I wanted to love this so bad I tried it for a month and thought okay maybe my skin is going through the purging phase but I just keep breaking out Didnt work for my skin sadly Not impressed with this cleansing oil I am a double cleanser and have tried many over the past few years As an oil this seems to have a thicker viscosity and almost feels like a drier oil than most It doesnt emulsify much once water is added either My biggest issue with this cleanser is that it does not remove basic mascara without extra product and extra rubbing defeating the whole purpose of an oil cleanser removing and melting makeup easily Ive never used an oil cleanser that didnt instantly melt my mascara Definitely would not repurchase\\nread more Great oil cleanser to remove that layer of makeup before giving your face a proper wash It also has a great yet light scent The only downfall is it doesnt remove mascara as easily as youd expect Feels nice on the skin but it is not worth the price You can find better oil cleansers if you search for korean beauty products I dont wear much make up which is why I like this product as a basic face cleanser is okay nice light oil good for my sensitive and dry skin However it does not clean the foundation off of my skin If I use a cotton pad after using this product its full of make up I used a full bottle of this oil and felt it never left my face feeling refreshed afterwards It takes off the surface layer of makeup that you can see but it leaves a slightly oily feeling I always felt there is still something on my face and would always cleanse again after Unscented Feels nice on skin but doesnt remove my mascara like other facial cleansing oils have Been using this product for about a month now and I love it It removes makeup so nicely and leaves your face soft before cleansing Adding double cleansing has changed my skin I really only use this if Im wearing a full face of makeup for the day as I feel I like two pumps to fully remove all the makeup This leaves skin feeling soft and clean and I have dry skin so thats a plus My only complaint would be thats its expensive and for me personally Id go though it quickly using more then one pump to remove my makeup but highly recommend\\nread more Love this product in my skin care routine for double cleansing I love Murad products and thought that I would give this cleanser a try due to the really good reviews on here However it made my dry and sensitive skin feel super dry tight and have that grippy feeling to it after using it It starts out creamy but once you rinse with water it really foams up Foaming cleansers tend to strip my skin no matter what though It also has a very distinct soapy scent which I didnt enjoy I feel like this product would be wonderful for people with oily or combination skin or even people who like that super clean grippy feeling after cleansing but I do not unfortunately Will be going back to exchange for my kopari cleansing oil\\nread more My face feels so good after using this product I havent seen any improvement in my skin texture its not the worst product nor is it the best product its just meh Love this product not loving the nearly ten dollar price increase at sephora However this tube lasts me nearly a year so a little goes a long way and dramatically reduces that cost in comparison to drugs store products Received a deluxe size of this as part of the holiday gift set It worked great at exfoliating my skin but not drying it out However after less than 2 weeks of use it precipitated little white pellet balls Not sure what happened I still have about 23 of the bottle left but cant use it Not sure if the full jar would have this issue Broke my skin out Horribly My skin has never been this bad I broke out with pimples all over my face and this made my skin really dry I use this in the mornings and so far I love it I can feel it working on my pores and have seen a visible reduction in pore size My face purged when I started using this and fabs retinol serum at night but now my face is clearing up again I will continue to purchase I use this as well as the Retinol Serum from the brand  one night a week each I definitely like this stuff more than the Retinol I just find it a little thin But it rubs in quite nicely and the odour isnt too strong My acne is going down steadily and I trust the product and the brand enough to continue to use it because I know Ill continue to see results I took off a star because it is really drying but my skin is getting used to it and I am using Retinol as well As long as youre moisturizing sufficiently you shouldnt have too much of an issue with this product I like using GlamGlow Thirsty Mud the night after I use each of these really drying products I know that once my skin is used to it itll be happy and healthy and acne free\\nread more I love the FAB Skin Care line but I just couldnt get through the smell on this one It smelled like old expired lotion mixed with past due raw chicken I tried to work through it and simply wash my hands immediately after applying but even my husband and five year old would sit next to me at night and wonder what that smell was I thought perhaps it was an old bottle but I went back to the store and discovered this is just what the formula smells like So disappointed\\nread more I have dry skin and this cleanser dried my skin out further Left my face feeling very tight and rubbery This cleanser leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft and moisturized I dont feel like Im drying my skin out even when using it twice a day Would definitely purchase again I live in the south and I ordered this while it was still hot and humid out It was way too moisturizing then but not that the weather is beginning to cool off its great It works great After spreading it on my face then using a wash cloth my skin felt clean and very smooth without feeling squeaky The original smell was not great but the smell got worse after two weeks It smells kinda fishy It stayed in my cool bathroom the entire time Perhaps I got a bad batch Stings your eyes sooooo bad If you can handle that it does a good job at getting rid of makeup and oils This cleanser will last a long time you only need a small bit of it to get a good lather However it left my skin feeling tight and dry I was so excited to try this but my face did not feel clean the scent was irritating and I broke out afterward The performance of the cleanser is fine Not drying Works as a perfect second cleanse But the scent Its atrocious Like rancid roses Its enough that I cant bring myself to keep using it This is a good cleanser but I dont feel like you get enough product for the price Plus its just a good cleanser Theres not a whole lot magical about it besides it being nice for sensitive skin If it either was a little cheaper or came in a bigger bottle Id repurchase If you love their rose lineup youll likely love this cleanser too Sometimes we have days where we are lazy with our skincare no just me then and to have something thats super easy and where the smell is something to look forward to is nice Its a total luxury and nonnecessity and the amount you get for the price seems a little much but I dont regret buying it My face feels soft and clean after using it I have combination skin but my Tzone is incredibly oily and I would say that I feel this does a good job of balancing the skin Will this cleanser solve all of your skin problems Im not sure but the process of finding out is going to smell and feel delightful \\nread more I like the ease of a foam cleanser and it smells so good but I dont find it particularly cleansing It will not strip your makeup off so you do have to double cleanse with this Also not particularly moisturizing Over all its just a meh product Ive been using this cleanser for 56 months now and am on my second bottle It cleanses well without removing too much hydration from my dry and sensitive skin I dont know it it really does much too improve the texture or any of my issues like clogged pores but my skin feels nice afterwards and it hasnt caused any irritation A good buy overall if you have sensitivity concerns I really do like the products from fresh but they are a bit expensive for what they are I found it best to use this with dry hands on a dry face and then wet your hands if you needed to Applying this on a wet face didnt work well for me It smelled good wasnt nourishing but wasnt drying and I left my skin feeling really nice only a little tight I ended up using 3 pumps which may have been a little too much This product is great but not for the value if youre someone whos going to use it everyday youre going to run out of it quickly I got this as part of my travel skincare bag Im glad I got this during the 20 off sale because the price for the quantity is way too much\\nread more I have this product in my makeup kit for cleansing clients skin before application It is a nice genital cleanser though fragrant The pump foams the cleanser into you hand making it easy to leather with out dampening the skin I like this product because it suits all skin types with out leaving the skin felling striped It makes your skin smell like roses and leaves it refreshed and the foam formula makes it very gentle on the skin I am still waiting for results on my skin because i just started using it Do not like this product at all Doesnt leave your face feeling clean Used to use caudalie foam cleanser and wanna try something new This fresh one works fine but it smells terrible kinda fishy on my face I tried not to breathe when I was using it Do not spend your money on this product It smells absolutely horrible I might be able to overlook the smell if it actually did anything to my skin but sadly it did not I tried this product several times hoping I could either get used to the scent or see some sort of impact on my skin After using it at least 57 times I observed no positive effects on my oily skin and the smell was just too unpleasant to deal with This product stinks soooo bad It almost smells like bad BO and I did not see a difference in my skin at all In fact it caused some redness and made my Tzone more oily than usual This product does stink but not like sulfur It just straight up stinks However the smell doesnt last long It does mattify the skin but to do so it leaves a little powder residue on the skin which Im not a fan of But if you can get past the powder and the residue its great Contains the skin mattifying ingredients But at what price Alcohol will dry the skin and cause irritation with time Skin will produce even more skin fat Pay attention to this and dont anticipate much from this product First off I think some of these reviews are actually talking about the Saturn mask This doesnt even have sulfur in it It smells kinda fresh and a bit herbal to me Now I dont feel like it necessarily does anything for my acne other than leave it the heck alone I get hormonal often cystic acne flare ups once a month around my mouth andor jaw line and this is much nicer at not irritating my skin any further in these areas I also manage mild to moderate rosacea on my face and eyes This is where I love this product It has a lovely cooling effect on my cheeks which often feel warm during a flare up and doesnt irritate my skin like the drugstore toners tended to My sister saw me for the first time since I started using this recently and remarked that my face doesnt look as red as it usually does so perhaps it is helping with the redness as well I wish it wasnt so pricey though\\nread more Ive started using this product for about 3 days and so far I love it I hate the smell of it but it literally goes away after about 10 minutes It definitely has controlled my oily face The smell I used it once and immediately returned it I dont care how it works it smells like vomit Sorry but true I love the other Sunday Riley products but not this one Yuck Gurl that SMELL It smells like a dumpster Dont buy it sweetie Im happy with the results of this product but my GOD does it stink Like someone else mentioned its reminiscent of a dirty dish rag or something I almost gagged the first time I want to love it and reorder but I probably wont because of the smell Even though Im happy with the results it produces the smell is just too brutal to endure I feel like this product really doesnt do much at all for my skin I have combination skin and bought this on recommendation from a Sephora associate Id heard good things about the brand so I shelled out the dough for it Its slightly cooling when you put it on but I found it made my skin sticky and gross It also smells like straight up VOMIT Im not mincing words here because I think people need to know this before they buy the smell of this toner makes me sick to my stomach every single time I use it The smell dissipates fairly quickly but since it really isnt great on my skin I just dont think this is worth it Maybe if I used it every single day for a long time Id see some results since it is skincare and it can take time to see a payoff but with the smell I cant bring myself to use it\\nread more smells super bad but it does mattify the skin would not buy based on the scent though its strong and super noticeable This product is something that should definitely be sampled first The smell is terrible and the product does seem to have only minimal benefits I noticed my skin looked more matte after cleansing and applying this toner but it was negated by some of the products I used afterwards such as my moisturizer I havent noticed any breakouts using this product but I dont think theyve gotten better either But to each their own\\nread more Couldnt tell you if its even good the smell is so terrible Ill never use it again I used this for a week and it made my skin feel soft however the smell is terrible It smells so bad boyfriend asked me if I vomited I thought I could get use to the smell but I couldnt Had to return it I had to wash my face again after applying this Whatever benefits it has are outweighed by the nasty smell it has on my skin Dont waste your money Tried a sample tonight but cant get passed the smell Its so awful I immediately fanned it to dry so I could apply moisturizer but I can still smell it and it reeks I love Sunday Riley products but will definitely not be adding this to my routine This stuff smells so bad I knew the odor was going to be pungent but even after reading the reviews I figured it cant be that bad I was so wrong The smell is horrible Ive only used it twice and I just cant use it again The smell makes me sick I honestly cant say if this works or not because I cant use it because the smell is horrible Believe me when I say this stuff STINKS Literally This is honestly the worst The woman in the store told it would smell a little natural By natural she meant pond algae It was terrible There is no masking the scent I couldnt get past it My husband wouldnt come anywhere near me It could be the most effective product on earth but the smell is horrendous Such a good toner Ive been using it for a couple weeks and I can say it makes my skin feel very calm and clean I suffer with cystic acne and I really feel like this is the reason why it is clearing up I switched contraceptives and my skin really effected from it that being said Ive never experienced painful cystic acne so I picked this product up to try it out and I can really tell the difference My skin still has some acne scars from overly picking at my skin but I do believe that this product will help and my skin should be clear very soon Very thankful for this product I do have dry skin so I have to moisturize after using this product\\nread more I suffer with pretty chronic chin pimples which I believe are hormonal and this cleanser really helped clear them up It makes my skin feel so fresh and cleansed after each use I love anything Kiehls and this product is definitely worth the price A little goes a long way too Love the clean feeling I get This is my second step of my double cleanse to remove makeup My face is clean but not parched and it smells really good Hate the smell Also its hard to lather Definitely cant use this everyday Good cleanser great for whiteblack heads Has a minty refreshing feeling on the skin but not irritating Gives you a good clean but would recommend going in with another cleanser first if youve been wearing makeup I have oily acne prone skin and used this for 3 weeks I saw no change and used this along with the oil free toner and moisturizer Its an okay cleanser but it did nothing to my skin It wasnt too drying or anything but i also didnt like the way it felt when i washed my face I never used the old formula so I cant compare the 2 but I will be returning This product did worked for my skin its not the best but my acne is lot more better since am using this product YO THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT IVE EVER USED Do not waste your money one this product It broke my face out so much and I will never be buying anything from this brand ever again Thats how upset I am about the results it gave me My birthday is next week and I have to somehow clear up my face before then Started using this over a month ago and I still have a lot of blemishes on my face It does help on my breakouts when I do have them I never experienced the old formula so I cant relate Ill keep using it till its finished If I dont see any other changes then I will not be using this again I wish this product was in stores so I could have tried a sample firstI saw someone online raving about this so decided to give it a try even though its very expensive for what it is To me this smells TERRIBLElike an old lady perfume Heavy rosehydrangea scent I prefer to use unscented products as scented things are not good for my skin It is very sticky like a thick vaselineIf you want something like this just order the Clinique balmI prefer an oil cleanserwill likely have to return this due to the horrible scent To me it didnt taken my makeup off as quickly as my oil cleansers and I got 2 small breakouts the next am after the first time using thisnot sure if this was just a coincidence but I usually never break out\\nread more This smells alright but is so thick it clogged my pores I bought it to leave on overnight since my skin is so dry but it was just greasy and never totally absorbed in I used a little and really rubbed it in but that didnt help much This product is amazing It works super well as a moisturizer and has a nice light rose smell to it As a cleansing balm it removes the majority of my make up but not all of it I usually use a make up wipe or micellular water to remove the little bit of make up that still lingers I have super sensitive skin but this product never irritates it which is nice Its a bit on the pricier side for cleansing balms but definitely worth it as the ingredients are super good for your skin and help in anti aging\\nread more Smells decent and feels decent as an overnight moisturizer Nice as a cleansing balm after makeup has already been removed I really wanted to love this product but found it to just be ok Im very surprised no one has mentioned how sticky this is I just received it and washed my face off worked pretty good for makeup removal Then I put on a medium amount for a night mask and I can barely stand it I am about to get up and wash it off I could not sleep like this Also has quite a strong perfume smell that Im not loving I plan on taking this back tomorrow Super bummed Liked it very much except too strong old ladys perfume It moist skin deeply and cleans makeup well When extremely dry used it as mask overnight and worked super good Wish it has natural fragrance It isnt easy for me to rate this 3 stars because this was my most anticipated purchase last year I dont hate it  but I only love it because its Charlotte Tilbury I have used this as secondary wash after my initial face cleansing doesnt remove makeup well enough on own Actually quite disappointed in this product I love Charlotte Tilbury products but the smell is very strong and I honestly am not a fan It also does not really work well Does not budge the mascara second wash is imperative Would honestly like my money back It was very expensive Leaves my skin feeling great after Takes off mascara well Scent is not too strong for me as other users have indicated very rough on skin the make up does bot even wash off the cloth i want to return not worth the 22 Used a few times and get good results Felt like a deep clean with exfoliation Larger than they need to be but would repurchase Luxury item What Muslin IS wonderful as well as one of the most inexpensive fabrics you can buy even if youre looking for 100 organic cotton Theres nothing special about the weave of this product vs what you can find in a fabric store The only boon is the tidy tailored edges though it seems like even that is too fragile to be worth it The cloths are gentle and dont irritate my sensitive skin They are also easy to wash and dry very quickly Even though they are slightly pricey they are great quality and will last a long time These do the job but honestly I dont understand the hoopla around these There is nothing special or luxurious about these They remind me of fine handkerchiefs from days past A bit over rated and expensive imho for these Initially I loved these but they fray big timeeven when washed in the gentle cycle and line dried I didnt expect them to last forever but I certainly figured theyd last more than a couple uses Friendly for sensitive skin so far The price though While I have used this for years because it claimed to be alcoholfree after being more ingredient conscious I saw that benzyl alcohol is listed as an ingredient so it is not alcohol free Also this contains a paraben namely methylparaben so I switched to one of Sephoras clean alcohol free toners intstead This is one of the worst toners I have used irritated my skin and it has alcohol big no no I really love this toner This was 1st true love toner However now that I am learning so much about skin care I would feel more comfort using something that is at least going in the direction of becoming clean or vegan Because of this choice this will be my last Lancôme toner purchase Despite of that this is a great toner that does not dry out my skin and actually feels like it gives it that extra clean For a while this worked so well on me However I ended up switching because for the price its not clean at all parabens dyes and fragrance If those things dont bother you this is great but I switched because of that This is a really lovely smelling gentle toner I loved using it before bed It leaves skin soft and smooth in winter I do not feel that I noticed a difference in the tone of my skin In the summer I went back to natural witch hazel for my oily skin While I loved how gentle this toner was I used it for about 2 weeks and noticed that it was breaking me out It was the only new thing that I had introduced into my routine so I know it was the culprit and Im not usually very sensitive to having scented skincare products but my skin didnt agree with something in this toner If you have sensitive skin I would try a smaller sample first before committing to the full size\\nread more I like the smell and the appearance of the bottle It feels nice on my skin and it makes me feel fresh in the morning The big down side to this is that it hasnt really done anything for my skin  good or bad I bought this after spending a long time at the store trying to find the perfect toner for my skin For the first few times I used it it made my skin feel soft and supple But the smell was so pungent And after a few days of use my skin looked so red and angry I returned it right away I do not recommend this if you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to strong smells I love this cleanser It left my face feeling super clean without it feeling stripped of moisture The only reason I removed a star is because of the packaging I hate the fact this is a twist off lid for a cleanser It should have a standard flip top that way youre not leaving the cleanser open and on its side with the potential of it leaking out whilst youre washing your face Change the lid and this is a 5 star product This caught my eye as I was browsing one day I thought wow I could use a cleanser for winter since my skin will be more dry I fell in love with the scent and bought it Took it home and used it once I noticed my face felt like Id used a bar of soap immediately after washing it off My skin dried out over night and had so many rough patches the next day Returned NOT FOR DRY SKIN This cleanser lathers really well so a little goes a long way and leaves your face squeaky clean I have sensitive acne prone skin and this cleanser did not dry my skin out for comparison origins checks and balances really dried me out My skin felt soft and hydrated after washing It has a mild pleasant scent and the bottle lasted me awhile note packaging made it difficult to squeeze out last of the product Give it a try\\nread more I expected the cleanser to be much better Instead its hard to wash off and my skin feels dry after I use it Personally I would not buy it again Ive been using this product for 14 days now but today I decided to call it quits When it lathers it feels nice however as I rinse it off its hard to do that gently without feeling like my hands are dragging on my face Then Id notice my face would have slight redness and a bit of stinging around the lower half of my face After a few uses the same thing would happen but I started noticing tiny bumps around my chin and jawline I only break out on my cheeks and forehead also my pores never looked clean Today I used a standard CeraVe cleanser and my jawline is already starting to feel normal again I wanted to like this considering its 26 and natural but NOPE Ill be returning it The one star is just because it smells nice but fragrance is no helper either\\nread more Not worth the price Its a nice feeling cleanser that doesnt leave my dry skin tight but I wouldnt say its hydrating or leaves me thinking I have to keep purchasing Theres better hydrating cleansers out there Leaves your skin clean but you need to moisturize soon after as it can also be a bit drying Large bottle means it lasts a WHILE and will not irritate your skin Ive never had such a negative experience with a face wash This product leaves a waxy rubbery film on my skin even after multiple rinses Its really unpleasant This is a really nice Toner Great for Sensitive Skin and the smell is invigorating and energizing My only complaint is I feel its overpriced for what it is The smell is fine but my face felt itchy after use And after I stopped using it my face was back to normal My first go to for morning routine I wash my face at night Apply a ton of serums and lotions and this is what I wipe my face off with in the am Combination skin on the side of dry in winter this is the best toner that gets the rest of my makeup off and is moisturizing Why only 3 the scent is a bit strong for me It works well on my sensitive skin I have normal to dry skin just not sure it did anything for me Ive been using this every day for the last 4 days The first 2 days it was fine At the 4th day now and it stings and it dries out my face I have sensitive skin and it does not work for me It feels as if theres alcohol on it without having alcohol in it My skin has been changing recently from oily to more combonormal I have some pretty dehydrated skin right now from everything intended to mattify oily skin  its taken a long time to find items that work Unfortunately this wasnt one of them I used the Origins Checks  Balances cleanser before this  the two did nothing to help rehydrate my skin after cleansing Even after using the Origins A Perfect World daytime moisturizer my face felt tight and uncomfortable Together my skin was still lacking moisture If you are looking for a toner that also moisturizes this is not it\\nread more I like everything but the bottle hole Its too wide to use itself without cotton pads Every time I apply it with my hands then I spilled it you should use cotton pads or use another bottle First off the smell is amazing It smells like fruit loops in the best way Sooo good I didnt see much of a differencechange in my skin but it did leave it feeling fresh and clean each time It says its a lotion but it is watery Its not a toner there is no applying it to a pad just what splash it on your face Thats not lotion It didnt do much for my face but leave it on the dry side Maybe if you have normal skin and want something light I dont know If someone has insight on this I feel pretty daft right now I love this product My skin is very sensitive to just about everything But this product has been amazing I use it every time before applying moisturizer and I find I feel better moisturized Especially in winter my cheeks tend to get quite dry even with moisturizer but with this lotion combined with my usual moisturizer I feel much better relief from dry skin So far this is my favourite toner until I find another one Feels refreshing and the scent is quite light I didnt get a breakout after using this Ive been using this for years I have sensitive skin and sometimes eczema it doesnt irritate the eye at all and remove the eye make up well This Eye remover is not good for waterproof makeup I use to buy Esthederm High Tolerance MakeUp Remove wich I LOVE  but I decide to give a try to Clarins Instant eye makeup remover I dont think its made for heavy makeup or waterprook makeup Will return it it is effective but for the price tag i advise you to choose clinique or something equivalent instead  clarins feels great but we could better use it for rituallike selfcare This does an ok job of removing eye makeup but it smells like roses which I feel should be written in large writing in the description since I feel like makeup remover should be unscented and NEVER floral Its also pretty greasy I also like to remove eye makeup with a Q tip for the under eye and this has a tiny hole at the top where the liquid comes gushing out so it is hard to use it with anything other than a cotton ball I wont be buying again\\nread more I just keep coming back for this product it remover my eye makeup are so quick and gently I have been using this product for years and it works for me It removes everything its nongreasy and doesnt irritate or burn my dry sensitive eyes The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the price Finished the bottle not overwhelmed Cant say it performed any better than the toner I got at Target Wasnt bad but wasnt amazing either I was looking for a moisturizing toner to use on nights I incorporated retinol into my routine so I got this one It sounded amazing on paper but so far every time Ive used it my face is left stinging immediately after If you do not find witch hazel bothersome to your skin you will probably like this I have no real complaints about this product Im just not sure how much its benefiting my skin It applies nicely and I like that its a toner and an essence in one To me the more efficient you can make a skin routine the better So if anyone comes out with an Essence toner retinol and vitamin C moisturizer and sunscreen in one Ill be the first in line to try it  So while I havent noticed a huge difference in my skin appearance I havent broken out or had any unusual reactions and it saves me a step so Ill probably keep using it Im always looking and open to trying new things but right now this is one that Im very happy to come back to\\nread more I dont usually get allergic to anything but Ive been having breakouts and red bumps on my face after using this brand this toner the collagen and the cream Unfortunately I got them around Dec 2017 So return was not an option I opened them around Nov 2018 and found out I was allergic at first I thought it was me so I stopped for a while then restarted using them two days ago lets just say Ill never touch this brand again If youre thinking about purchase it consider ask for some sample and try them out first\\nread more Saw no improvement in redness or acne after a month of use Dont waste your money Nope Broke me out Usually have great experiences with algenist not this time 3 stars because Ingredients look really good so Im really surprised my skin reacted that way possible reaction to a certain ingredient I dont actually know if this makes a difference but I use it as my toner every night religiously  If youre looking for immediate resultsIm not sure if this is for u This toner made me break out severely I stopped using it for a while to be sure that it was this toner that was causing breakouts and yes when I restarted using it I started breaking out again Breakouts arent exactly what I want from a toner so its a no from me This is a great toner Probably the best Ive tried so far It fulfills all my requirements for a toner it gives an extra clean tightens up my pores keeps my skin balanced throughout the day and compliments my serum and moisturizer The only problem I have is with the packaging It is designed to keep the product from flowing freely Therefor you have to shake the bottle to get the product out This is a serious design flaw since most are usually trying to get the product onto a cotton ball or cotton pad A lot of product gets needlessly wasted because of this Would be 5 stars if not for the packaging\\nread more The only reason I am not giving this five stars is the price I burn through this stuff way too fast The fact that I keep buying it is a testament to how great it is It is light and refreshing I feel it balances my skin and preps it for serums I definitely notice IMMEDIATELY when I stop using it my combo skin breaks out within days I now buy two at a time A pretty good toner Doesnt overdry and makes skin feel fresh I have textured skin with an oily tzone and often get pimples on my chin This didnt irritate or leave any residue and also absorbed well It isnt anything spectacular enough to get me to pay for it again as I have found some good results with rose water as well for a fraction of the price Its a little drying I think due to the witch hazel which wasnt expected I will use it up but probably not repurchase as I use Retina and dont like the added dryness after I use it This is a fine toner and a really good price considering how much you get However it didnt really do much for my skin My skin didnt feel any more hydrated than when I use a rosewater mist maybe even less so and I think it even sensitized it a bit maybe because of the witch hazel or the added fragrance I used most of it but wont repurchase As an exfoliant it does the job well without stripping the skin This exfoliant does not make my skin feel tight after cleansing with it as it has a creamy consistency Will not be repurchasing due to the smell  its as if I were walking into a hospital I often mix it with my cleanser in the shower so that I can mask the smell Ive never written a beauty product review before Im a mom and work full time Who has time to write reviews 0 I bought this against my better judgement I read a review saying this product smells like hot garbage Hot garbage How can that be Cant be that bad I thought Its THAT bad Trust me I use this product in the shower and literally hold my breath as I use it I cant wait to finish it I wont throw it out because I dont like wasting money I love First Aid Beauty products and use many but this one was a total fail So sad\\nread more I like this cleanser a lot  rinses clean exfoliates well Unfortunately the smell is really offputting I dont shop for cleansers based on scent but this one is so unpleasant it takes away from the experience I wont use this It smells like old cigarettes Its awful My boyfriend wanted to try an exfoliator so we ordered this one online I tried it first and was caught off guard by how strongly it smells like tobacco especially given that its marketed as unscented He tried it and then said yeah this is literally like putting cigarettes on your face We wondered if maybe it just had to air out a little but sure enough the following night it still smelled like cigarette smoke Returning this exclusively because of the smell  neither of us actually used it enough to get a sense of its impact on skin\\nread more Im glad I got this as a mini in a set and did not purchase the full size It is drying and there are not enough scrubbing granules to do much exfoliating That is probably a good thing because the granules themselves are too rough You might as well get the popular apricot scrub from the drug store It is harsh but it exfoliates better and doesnt dry out your skin I love First Aid Beauty products and this one is no exception Its not harsh when it comes to the scrub and leaves my skin incredibly smooth after use I didnt give it 5 stars though because of the scent It is quite overwhelming  almost smells like campfire Seems like from the reviews its hit or miss if you can smell it though Not sure what this is supposed to do If its exfoliation to brighten I would say a hard pass There are others that do better Meh at best for this one I think this product does an adequate job I bought it to try after using the ole Hendrickson exfoliator I loved the OH one but wanted to try something new This one has a funky smell Im not wild about and there is much less texture than the OH pore Balance product I was very excited about trying this product since Ive really enjoyed many of the FAB products but I highly disliked this product Not only did it smell god awful like a garbage full of kitty litter but it had next to no exfoliating beads in it meh Its ok but I prefer the fresh sugar face polish I test a lot of products Im still looking for my HG products for several steps in my skincare routine Trouble is my skin is highly reactive so I often end up with a rash about 2 weeks after starting a product This cleanser is one I turn to when my skin is in that state It doesnt worsen the reactionrash eczema or whatever state its in and it may even soothe the situation a bit I dont feel like it does much more than that not that thats a small thing though It claims to brighten and exfoliate as well as help with uneven texture I dont feel like it does any of that It looks a bit shiny when you squeeze it out of the tube but thats as close as it gets to brightening A good thing to have when my skin gets angry but Im looking for more in a cleanser\\nread more This is a nice and gentle physical exfoliator that does just enough but not too much Im sensitive and prone to irritation and this one gives me no issues Theres no extra unnecessary ingredients and its fragrance free This would be a great exfoliator to keep around and great for someone starting out looking to add something gentle to their skincare regimen The smell The scarce amount of exfoliant particles The texture It was all just a major miss for me did nothing for my skin and it felt like I still needed to wash my face again after I used it Usually I love FAB but this was returned I really like this cleanser its not super rough on the skin and I love exfoliating cleansers The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the scent is kind of weird I wish it had no scent like the ultra repair cream or even a floral scent would be nice This stuff does its job and doesnt irritate my skin I have super oily skin with patches of eczema around my nose Some people seem to dislike the smell but I never mind the smell of a product as long as its does its purpose Im going to try another exfoliater after this but I did use the whole bottle It just was g anything special Honestly never purchasing again the rough side hurts and is like sand paper And I have normal skin Idk how anyone can use these in peace SO ROUGH I dont know how anyone uses the exfoliating side on their face it feels like sandpaper and actually hurts Way too rough The soft side is great and it smells amazing but I like to use both sides of the wipe Wont buy again but would if they made an allsmooth version I think the pineapple wipes are my favorite of the Sephora Collection I use them when I actually need to remove makeup so the exfoliation side is important and follow up with a quick rinse Scent is pleasant a little perfumey but not bad or too heavy I love these wipes I repurchased them 3 times Theyre great for oily and acne prone skin These wipes cleared my skin so fast Anytime I have a breakout I know I can count on theseSeriously worth the money Smells super amazing  exactly like fresh cut juicy ripe pineapple  and quite a strong scent too I think the design is really clever the smoother side is soft and removes makeup pretty well and the rougher side is quite coarse and feels like its efficiently exfoliating The only downside is the residue afterwards sort of oily and shiny not the best toner I used I got this for my acne didnt get to finish using it it is pretty dry for my face I think its ok to use it during summertime but in winter its too dry for me thats I give 4 stars other than dry for wintertime other things are fine My skin tends to be dry and lately I have been experiencing issues with large open pores with hard blackheads in them I was looking for something to help with that in addition to not stripping my skin The smell is VERY herbal but isnt entirely offputting It hasnt improved my skin any at allI may even go as far to say it has made it worse and am now experiencing itchiness all over with excess oil production That aside the amount of product for the price is a good value should it be something that works for someone else I wont be finishing the bottle or repurchasing\\nread more Its gentle and doesnt leave my skin feeling stripped Wouldnt mind a little more hydration Nice hydrating toner No alcohol sting after exfoliating Minus one star for the weird smell or lack thereof Not the smell or feel I was expectingpretty underwhelmed Not bad but I will not be repurchasing Very refreshing The herbal smell makes me feel like i just left the spa and my face feels even cleaner after a wash I also love that it doesnt sting and helps balance out the oiliness on my face Made my skin more red and Irritated  I love Kiehls but this toner wasnt for me great soothing toner that doesnt irritate my skin just wish it didnt have dye in it Worked okay for a bit until my face started getting dry out of nowhere My cheeks and eyelids and forehead starting looking cracked and felt itchy My cheeks were getting red as well I thought this toner would rejuvenate my skin but it made my skin feel itchier and did not lessen the redness Wish I had listened to the reviews about this product burning when it was used but I figured I would give it a shot because maybe my experience would be different Plot twist  it wasnt I also have sensitive skin and it actually really stung The next morning I woke up and had completely broke out all over my face as well so sadly never using this one again I have sensitive combination skin that is acne prone I used this twice and I have never had my skin react so poorly to a product before this one Where I applied the toner my skin gradually became extremely red The morning after my face was covered in breakouts Tiny white pimples everywhere and I mean everywhere I washed my face and it felt like I was using an exfoliant thats how textured my face was Returning this ASAP\\nread more This says it is for dry skin but I found that my skin got dryer as I kept using this I plan on returning it to Sephora This didnt work for me at all I was a little disappointed as all of the Kiehls products that I have tried and currently use are amazing for my skin but not this one I plan to try another toner from the line and hope to get better results This toner does not sting but it does not stand out to me either That is matching it against a far more expensive brand but moisture sprays work nearly as well For the price its not bad I thought this would make my face feel more hydrated but feels dry after Found this to be too harsh for the face Felt like scrubbing sandpaper on the face So I even tried to be gentle with scrubbing but still would feel like my cheeks got a rug burn Too gritty to be a facial scrub it was so harsh it made me breakout Could potentially be used on the body instead Havent tried that personally being that I am prone to breakouts I bought this product to brighten the acnes dark spots on my body I did not notice any changes on my skin so I was not satisfied with the results Not worth its price Really like how gentle but effective this is as an exfoliator I have just started using prescription Retin A for my wrinkles and the flaking and peeling is awful I use this exfoliator followed by Belief True Cream Aqua Bomb and I can look normal As for all the same day reviews That was probably when we all received it in our monthly beauty box 2 stars for clean beauty great packaging and female founder girl power However this actual product is so unbelievably underwhelming Ive been using it 23x a week on my 30 year old skin for quite awhile It is not an effective exfoliator and it doesnt brighten anything It lacks the acid content to give a good chemical exfoliation and it lacks in physical exfoliators Some reviews say this scrub is abrasive but if theres no chemical exfoliants to do the job then you need something I think I keep using this product at this point because I feel bad throwing it out\\nread more This scrub is very abrasive I found it similar to the Fresh Umbrian Clay scrub No suds and very scratchy It felt a bit like oil with sand in it it felt very awkward to use Although it is described as safe for sensitive skin it was too abrasive for me If you are sensitive like me but still want a good scrub off try the Caudalie Deep Cleansing Exfoliator instead This is a fairly gentle exfoliant Nothing super special about it in my opinion but it does what it advertises This product reminds me of St Ives apricot walnut scrub the kind that was slammed for being too abrasive and harsh I ended up mixing this with a body scrub It is nice as a body scrub but way too expensive to be used as such Turmeric is minimal Smell is nice This is way too harsh for the face but OK for body use There are just better scrubs out there so this one is a pass for me This product has harsh ingredients that irritated my skin Would not recommend for use at all but especially avoid using on your face Did not do anything for my skin no brightening I used it as a body wash to finish the tube I wanted to like it as much as I like Volition gelee mask Takes off waterproof mascara in a pinch and the cap on the bottle is sturdy enough that I do not have to worry about it opening and leaking in my overnight bag Price is steep but this does not pull out my eyelashes and leave product residue like the Garnier blue bottle I was using I received this product as a sample and just recently purchased the full size I dont like the oil based texture on my face I rather use a face cloth but I discovered it great for removing makeup on your brush its removes fast and dry fast as well For the price and the name of the product I was very hopeful that this would get rid of some of my more stubborn mascara Did not work Even after rubbing my eyes vigorously it would still leave on mascara and I had to double up with a second makeup remover Not worth the money at all Works okay not sure if I want to repurchase it Sensitive skin friendly but ran out too quickly This removed all my mascara easily but it really burned my eyes Even diluted with a wet cotton pad it still bothered me So I returned it Its a bit disappointing I still have to rub pretty hard to get the mascara off and it irritates the skin around my eyes It works but I dont like how much I have to rub to get my mascara off I bought this and I regret not reading the ingredients  alcohol is mostly in it  alcohol drys out your skin Im scared to even use this  I hate having dry skin and flakes  I will be returning this as soon as I can its full of alcohol I try to stay away from stuff like this but for the first time I just trusted Clinique and just bought it  Big mistake I love this product it really clean my face and it feels good after Honestly this is pure alcohol I regret buying the big size because it is way too harsh on my skin Leaves skin very dry and tight I did not like this toner Besides the fact that it didnt have a great smell it did absolutely nothing positive for my face I wouldnt purchase this again This is a very average toner I have dry and sensitive skin and was expecting more from this product It didnt irritate my skin at all which is surprising given the witch hazel but it didnt improve it in any way either There are better toners out there Gentle but basic toner Love this toner and love the fact that I dont need cotton swabs I really like toners but can never seem to keep track of my cotton swabs so this toner appealed to me Milk has been a decently consistent brand for me and this toner has done nothing but good for my skin Less pimples and healthier skin I really wanted to like this product The pros were that you can just apply it no need for cotton or reusable pads but the cons were that you didnt know if anything was happening to your face I felt like I was just applying something and nothing was happening plus for the amount i got and the price I could get a 15 dollar one the Mario badescu with 8 fluid oz  that has more and you feel it working right way than the mini version of this that is 1 oz and lasted me maybe 2 weeks that would accumulate\\nread more Like the concept of MILK toner the only thing about this one is it gets dry after a certain time maybe because of the compact size Wish the moistureproduct stays longer I started using this for about a week and made no difference I mainly bought it to help my acne but didnt work at all Also the product kept falling out of its container Not worth it I would not recommend this product for oily skin because it makes it worse When I get a toner I want it to make my skin feel refreshed and renewed Not something to make my skin feel more oily and clog my pores Decent for onthego toning Its more of a gimmick but it is very soothing on the skin It does calm inflammation slightly the white residue it leaves if u even try to spread the product around with your fingers just feels wrong it feels moisturizing but doesnt feel like a toner I dont know what I was expecting The packaging is super cute but the product doesnt do anything for me and it leaves a sticky feeling So much better than I expected Ive been using this for a couple of months now My skin is generally pretty sensitive to new products but this has been so great with my skin Minimized my pores and toned down redness not to mention it feels so nice and cool on skin really enjoy this for an after facewash boost i do enjoy milks cooling water stick better tho ive had noticed results quickly with that one Product is very sticky I didnt like it at all It does have a good smell but I wouldnt buy it again I wanted to love this product so badly as I am obsessed with MILK however it doesnt soak in to my skin at all instead leaving a waxy layer I can feel sitting on my face It doesnt allow for any other product applied after to soak in so my moisturizers are useless when using this I will not be repurchasing My skin just felt sticky and it made no visible difference to my skin It also made my makeup pill I tried using less and still got the same pilling Not terrible but doesnt really do anything It might work for some people but Im not sure what it would actually do I dont know why but a couple weekS into using this and my skin is freaking out Ive had more breakouts in the last week than I did in my teens I really like the normal to dry formula of this toner but I was starting to get a bit oily so when I ran out I thought Id try the combooily formula because thats what my skins usually man I was wrong Also wth fragrance This formula compared to the Normal is so heavily scented that its offputting\\nread more This toner smells and feels nice but I honestly dont know if it does anything It doesnt strip or dry your face but I dont think I will repurchase I do love how this product does not dry out the skin and doesnt have that alcohol feel to it I use it morning and night and pat it down on my face before applying my moisturizer I have seen a difference in my skin mostly when I wake up I just dont love the perfume smell its a little too strong and I feel like Im putting on a fragrance on my face I wouldve loved it without that added fragrance I wanted to change my skincare products after using them for 3years so I ran to Sephora and bought this along with Laneiges moisturizer and Cleanser with really high hopes of getting a more glowing skin After only 5 days of usage I was regretting my decisionmy skin broke out so bad I was so disappointed I dont enjoy layering myself up with makeup and like investing into good skincare products so I can maintain the natural glow and freshness on my face These products ruined it all for me\\nread more No no and no This product is full of fragrance As soon as I opened the top it smelled like a perfume shop I didnt like how it felt on my face or how my face smelled afterwards I will be returning this product My skin has been definitely started to look better since using thisalong with a few other products Ive added to my skin care routine Only complaint is that it does leave me with a filmysticky type feeling even after it has dried but it does go away once Ive applied my moisturizer I dont find this product particularly helpful in reducing sebum production I also dont think the active ingredients are concentrated enough to make a difference even after religious use Does it balance your skins pH after cleansing Im not convinced In my humble opinion you are better off using a toner thats more generous with AHAs andor BHA It doesnt dry your skin out doesnt sting when applied on breakouts and it smells good but I havent seen a difference at all in my skinif anything the blackheads on my nose are more pronounced since using this product Ill probably try something else once I run out of this Has a really great fresh scent but alcohol is literally the second ingredient and it is SUPER drying I have oily combo skin and with ONE use I was already dry around my mouth and nose area and had signs of irritation when I put on my moisturizer straight after Wouldnt recommend Okay so I love the smell but it is DEFINITELY a strong perfume scent so if you have sensitive skin or dont like strong scents I would stay clear from this A lot of times I use a cotton round first  then Ill use my toner as an essence for a little splash or pat in I would not recommend using this as an essence because of the smell strictly cotton round lol All around it was a pleasant experience  my skin liked it Ill have to try it for a couple more weeks before I notice if it helps balance my oily T zone\\nread more This toner made me breakout like crazy Ive never had acne so bad until I used this Rows of breakouts on my cheeks and forehead And I know it was the toner because it was the only thing in my routine that changed Its also fairly drying and smells a bit like rubbing alcohol Its a bit deceptive because after using it your face looks really nice and it minimizes your pores but its really just slicked away every drop of moisture left after cleansing Ive used both of the toners Laneige sells and I did not have the same problems with the other one I know alcohol is one of the main ingredients in both but their other toner didnt feel as drying nor did it cause any breakouts I have combination skin which both claim to work for Im not sure why this particular toner caused so many problems for me\\nread more I have been using this toner for a month and so far Im happy with it Its very refreshing and skill feels clean after it One star off for the alcohol but other than that this toner is great for my oily skin Ive been using this for a few weeks now and I could not feel the alcohol AT ALL I even went back to the ingredient list to see if they reformulated it since I last read it a few months ago when I first considered it I really recommend this it feels so hydrating and like real recovery for the skin I HATE that there is alcohol in it but I love how my skin looks and feels when I use it It does have a fresh and clean scent as well Broke my skin out I have oily T zone and combo skin Not sure what else to say but did not work with me will unfortunately have to return This product contains alcohol Toners with alcohols age you over time It also smells strong like alcohol Great toner It helps to reduce the redness of my skin and minimize the oil My skin feels clean immediately after applying it And I love that its a clean product This product did not cause acne and was not super drying for me However I didnt notice a real difference in the redness  texture of my skin Just a toner doesnt do anything at all Doesnt make the skin feel clean or refreshed doesnt tighten or brighten doesnt balance out the oils on the fave throughout the day Kind of a useless product Not sure if this toner did anything but definitely not worth the price Maybe I had high expectations because of the brand fame and comparing the price Id rather buy a drugstore one for the same purpose It is an okay product I LOVED it for balancing and oil control at first but then after using it for a few weeks straight it started drying out my skin really bad I have combination skin so it worked fine in some areas but the alcohol in the toner was very drying in others I wouldnt recommend it This is the first toner that doesnt break me out and its actually made my skin way less oily and dry Im not too crazy about the smell but it works amazingly well This product left my face worse than it was when I started using it It leaves my face completely dried out My face has started flaking and now has dry patches and even more discoloration than before It also has a really strong alcohol smell that makes my eyes water Very disappointed I usually enjoy Origins products but this one wasnt for me The strong alcohol fumes were too much for me Sigh The hunt continues for a toner for me I thought I really liked this product for the first few weeks My skin looked really smooth and it made a huge difference to how oily my forehead and chin would get without drying out my dry spots After a month of using it I noticed I was getting bad breakouts which usually I dont get other than my time of the month I tried removing just about everything Ive been using from my routine one by one and eventually removed this  I assumed it wasnt the culprit since Ive been using it over a month at this stage but now that Ive removed it and started using the last of my Milk toner instead the spots have started to go away after only a few days Shame since I thought this was helping my skin\\nread more I love how this smells and feels but I noticed my skin breaks out when I use it every day Upon closer inspection I see the alcohol content is high and its not good for the skin Ill be hunting for something else Such a pity as it does feel great but it dries the skin too much and then causes pimples I found it way to harsh for my skin and had to do a 2 day recovery with only basic gentle skincare routine My skin got this laqueur finish that just doesnt sit well with me If I were to use it again Id divide the contents of this into 3 or 4 parts I rarely ever react to any product I recently purchased the Fresh Pressed powdered cleansing packets I followed the directions exactly as they are written on the box and this product has caused severe breakouts all over my face I have not changed any other product in my beauty routine If you have sensitive skin I would reconsider purchasing this This is comparable to TATCHA Rice Enzyme Powder that Ive loved for years This Clinique one does the job and leaves the skin soft I like how this is separated into small packets instead of being in a big jar like the Tatcha However price wise its actually very expensive When I bought this I thought Im saving money over the Tatcha powder But instead counting the  per gram you pay more for this one This one turns out to be 210 per gram while the Tatcha one is 108\\nread more I used this product once a day for the entire 28 days and I did notice a nice change in my skin It was nothing drastic by any means however it did help to fade some of my dark spots from acne scarring I would recommend this to anyone that has mild dark spotsI bet it would clear those right up I used this 1x a day for 6 weeks and saw ZERO improvement to my complexion My sunspots didnt lighten or even out and my skin was left feeling only mildly exfoliated The cleanser works but I will not buy again because of the wasteful packaging I understand you only need a small amount but maybe just provide a small measuring spoon in a jar Also not a fan of the scent Its a little offputting and lingers after you dry your face I love this micellar water more than I thought that I would I love they way it makes my skin feel after cleansing I feel that this has made such a difference in the texture and the complexion of my skin after just 2 weeks of using DOUBLE CLEANSING is a must for me so I am hooked The only downside is that I am unable to use on my eyes  on my third bottle of this I love it it leaves my skin feeling calm and amazing after cleansing I alternate between this and the fresh rose toner depending on how my skin feels I use this when my skin needs more cleansing or toning and that when i need more hydration my only problem with this product is the price for how quickly you go through it because its a liquid it becomes one of the more expensive items in an arsenal of luxury products because I need 3 bottles a year while still alternating with another product but I still buy it so take from this what you will\\nread more I used about half of the bottle over a period of about 3 weeks before I realized this product was causing my skin more redness and an overload of tiny bumps across my forehead Most of the time clean products are good to my skin but this cleanser made my skin worse Residue I have used several micellar cleansers and this one leaves way more residue than any other Not a fan for my sensitive breakout prone skin This micellar cleansing water is pretty good I like to use it in the mornings because its quick gentle and efficient It is great for dry and sensitive skin though I think its suitable for all skin types Even though its pretty good I wont be repurchasing because I dont think its much different than any other micellar water that I can get for less money Iv been using this for a few months now and its a great cleanser but Im not sure it does much more than water on a cotton ball swiping up the last few bits of makeup Good micellar water nothing special It does smell really nice really clean and like lavender It does leave my face feeling ever so slightly sticky afterwards It made me breakout I didnt even realize it was this product causing it Stopped using it for a few weeks and then when I resumed my skin flared back up again Really disappointed because Ive tried several micellar waters and none have cause breakouts My favorite thing about this toner is the scent While I havent notice any skin benefits I love the scent It hasnt done anything for my skin It is like spraying perfume on your face It does have the tendency to burn if I have used adapalene or benzyl peroxide the day before I was using it to add extra moisture to my face but my skin still feels super tight and dry after using this The smell is nice and doesnt linger but I just cant see myself buying another bottle I really loved this product at first it removes redness perfectly and hydrates well too I used first bottle in one month and got another one Second bottle caused multiple breakouts in a half of a month of using Probably it happened because of coconut oil in it so be aware Leaves my face feeling refreshed and moist Does not dry out my skin and smells great too I have to start with the scent its so delicious with rose and sweet combination that triggers my childhood memory and makes me feel refreshed It also hydrates my dry normal skin and calming it after sun exposure I love it in general for summer but I dont think Ill use it for fall and winter I love the idea of having toner in a spray bottle but I HATE the smell Its like a mix of rose and bubblegum I wouldnt mind it that much if it was a subtle scent but its like spraying perfume on your face Im returning it This is definitely one of my favorite spray toners Most spray toners have a bit of a harsh spray but this one is soft and moisturizing It feels so good falling on to the skin and Kopari has yet again made another great product Not very hydrating Face feels dry again a few minutes after spraying This toner makes it difficult to apply face cream and primer Its not a bad cleanser but definitely not worth the price I like their soft lotion very much but didnt like their cleanser and toner Average product Im really surprised that this has such glowing reviews I ordered it based on the reviews There are a few of the La Mer products that I consider indispensable but this is not one of them For 90 I was expecting something really special Its micellar water Its very hydrating It removes all my makeup It does exactly what it is supposed to do But there is no way to justify this price even for a frivolous shopper like me There are SO many great micellar options out there for a fraction of the price I like this product I wear quite light makeup My makeup routine is always like this primer cushion foundation blush a little bit of conturing powder for my nose eyebrow powder I wear lash extensions so I dont really wear eye makeup This micellar water takes all my makeup off by using 2 cotton pads There is no need to really soak the pads for me but gotta get them wet enough I try to take off eye makeup sometime but it takes more to remove all the colors and waterproof eyeliner Also I can see my skin is improving At first I was afraid that only using this without washing my face with face wash would break me out Oh boy I was wrong This little friend is amazing for those who would get lazy at night after a long day like me It can take off everything without rinsing After I use this I apply toner with cotton pad and there is no residue on the pad Its really cool Its on a pricier side for a makeup remover without rinsing so I just take one star off\\nread more This is the perfect take your makeup off water cleanser At first I was skeptical about it I have previously used the Gariner micellar water cleanser and it didnt do much for me and felt like I still had to rinse again just to get the remainder of my makeup off But I went ahead and took a chance with La Mer and so glad I did I purchased the smaller size first which is 50 and I am loving it a little goes a long way and I no longer need to over rinse my face just to take off my makeup this doesnt it all for me The small bottle lasted me about 4 months and will definitely be repurchasing to the larger size Pricey but worth it\\nread more I like this micellar water I find it washes away all the makeup effortlessly But it leaves my skin feeling tacky and it smells like sunlight dish soap to me but I have to wash my face again with water or another cleanser afterwards which defeats the purpose For the price point I will continue to use the bottle I have but will not repurchase This may seem obvious but since this cleanser has oil in it it will ruin your lash extensions and make them fall off It doesnt seem to really get all the makeup off and anyone with acne should stay very far away Generally a blah product Removes makeup as well as any oil cleanser but caused my nighttime serums and moisturizer to pill up I wanted to love this product to the fullest because everything about it is great except it irritates my eyes every time Ive been using it for a few months as part of a double cleanse at night The texture is great and washes off easily Removed mascara and heavy makeup very well Theres a very mild scent which I didnt mind at all Unfortunately I will not be re purchasing because of the eye irritation I have combination skin Asian skin aged 33 acne prone and sun damage Used nickel size amount of cleanser on dry face to remove makeup it melts easily and spreads smoothly but does not completely remove eye mascaramakeup I use this as a first step  and then follow with a mild foam cleanser My skin is left with a layer after this keeping it hydrated  and after my second cleanse it doesnt feel dry As a cleansing balm you might be able to find similar products at lower price point Havent been able to see antiaging effects and might not be able to This is a luxury cleansing balm splurge if you have the money but I think you can find similar products elsewhere\\nread more I didnt like this one at all I had the one in the white bottle with a pump but they discontinued it It was much better This one turned into an oil but then it didnt emulsify into a foam and then I couldnt get the oil off my face with water I had to use a cotton pad to get it off and the makeup was still on my face So disappointed I love this product so far I want to see how well it works after 30 days Noticed zero change in my skin I was reluctant to buy this product and I was right I shouldve stuck with my regular serum I actually saw plumper and more radiant skin and I was just using a rewards travel size This is absolutely a fantastic product I am 24 and have been noticing indents appearing in between my brows I tried this for 28 days with no luck However it did make my skin feel so soft and lovely It was bitter sweet that I was suggested to apply it to all of my face For such an expensive product it would have lasted much longer if I was only using it on my problem areas Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the price I love this product Consent buy Had high hopes using every morning and have not seen even a slight change For the price I expected more I like this product I dont break out and it eases dryness Im well past the oily skin stage and certainly could use some help with lifting plumping etc But anything that feels greasy on my face is an immediate turn off And this was that Got it as a sample definitely would not buy I got this as a sample and am loving it I am in my late twenties and while I dont have deep lines I do have slightly sunken dark circles Its helped smooth out my skin around my eyes and the few small wrinkles around my eyes Definitely plan on buying the regular sized bottle although it is a bit pricey I have been using a sample of this product  loving it I will be purchasing once I run out Not hydrating at all My skin feels tight and dry after using it Not recommended in the winter This is another product I keep going back to As Im getting older I noticed I need to use a lot more product but I like that it not only hydrates and tightens my skin some it also acts like a primer and hides imperfections as well I purchased this because I hoped it would reduce pores visibility on my face I read good review about it The company website said it noncomedogenic However I regret buying this because it causes breakouts My face is now full of pimples I do not recommend this product for acne prone and sensitive skin Disappointed Been using this product for over two weeks with no noticeable difference in my fine lines I did give it three stars because my skin looks healthier since using it This product is just a bunch of silicones that give the appearance of smooth skin but does absolutely nothing Its a waste of money its like an overly priced primer basically On the other hand highly recommend the night repair serum is worth it Sorry ladies This does nothing for wrinkles and the texture of old time primers makes it even worse Shouldnt even be called a serum Not even any moisture here Not sure what purpose this serves Been using this for about a month and have been pleased with the results thus far Instantly slightly plumps fine lines and Ive seen a noticeable difference in my skin both in firmness and clarity since using I use two pumps every morning but would probably see more benefits if I used twice daily Fast absorbing nice smell and very lightweight I hate to say but this did nothing for me Maybe because I dont have any significant signs of aging at 28 but I found it didnt make my skin more radiant either I bought it because of the hyped up reviews and used it for a year every night and found no difference in my skin at all I wanted to like it but felt it had a very silicone after feel as well  oh well This is a nice entry retinol but has very little of the wow factor you hear folks raving about when they use retinol It didnt break me out or peel my skin which other retinols have done but it also wasnt strong enough to show any discernible changes I used this a few nights a week for a few months used the whole bottle with my regular skincare routine and saw minimal to no change in my skin That said  I am very sensitive and cant handle stronger retinols differin drunk elephant have both burnedpeeled my skin and this was very gentle My recommendation save your money on this one A better alternative OTC retinol for sensitive skinnewbies is the ROC brand from the drug store FWIW got this for free from a friend who works at First Aid Beauty I am not a bloggerinfluencer so dont think I need to disclose this but figure its helpful I also never had acneused Vitamin A and my skin is generally pretty good with a few fine linesacne scars\\nread more Hate the smell peels off my face Def not my fav from first aid beauty This was way too harsh for me Even when applied after serums and creams or diluted with serums and creams and used only 1xweek it still made my skin flake I tried multiple times and never was able to build a tolerance I have tolerated other retinol products well Sorry This makes my oily skin dry so bad This is not for sensitive skin I have to stopped using it I retuned the product Product was fine didnt cause breakouts and didnt sensitize my skin when used appropriately Results were average The pump on the bottle broke and product came out the sides so I returned itonly to have the new one do the same thing Better products and better packaging out there Purchased months ago and have given up trying to force myself to apply this unpleasant formula Im picky about ingredient lists because my skin is easily irritated and this passed muster Unfortunately everything else is a disaster Its sticky and thick doesnt absorb well then pills whether alone or under foundation Who wants Elmers glue all over their face Its very yellow which for fairer skin tones might actually show on the face The round smooth twistup packaging is poorly designedif my hands are even a little bit moist they keep slipping and I cant get the thing open Since when are peoples hands bonedry in the middle of skincare application\\nread more I made it through barely one application before giving up The twistup twistdown pump kept closing on me and the bright yellow color was a total turnoff I dont care how good the formula is I wont try it again Hate this brand All products are not good for sensitive skin like they claim to be This product and the AM triple duty eye cream specifically were just irritating and extremely drying especially for this one only being 25  retinol Just terrible There are so much better brands and products Staying away from this brand altogether from here on out I have combination skin thats very prone to breakouts Any change in skincare typically results in a 3 week purge Ive been using it for about a month and this product didnt make me break out at all Thats a major plus It also hasnt made my skin feel dehydrated like other retinol products have and my skin looks clearer brighter and my fine lines are less noticeable These are all the positives The one negative is that I can only use the product once per week even thought Ive been using other retinol products in the past It does cause quite a bit of flaking which shows up two or three days after application That being said I anticipate the flaking to stop the longer I use it Id definitely recommend it to anyone with sensitive or break outprone skin\\nread more I went to Sephora looking for something to help with a new sun spot I had developed I was recommended this product however it ended up creating white I have an olive skin tone splotches on my check where I used the cream I enjoy the product I had a little bit of purging at first but now my face is starting to clear up again I use this at night and the aha serum in the morning I will continue to buy this product This is the first retinol I have found that doesnt irritate my sensitive skin I havent noticed a big difference in my fine lines but I have noticed a huge improvement in the oiliness of my chin I use this and the AHA Resurfacing Liquid once a week each My skin does still get dry and perky and flaky but its minimized if you use lots of moisturizer and SPF during the day Ill also use GlamGlows Thirsty Mud twice a week the night after I use these products so that some intensive moisture is restored I am noticing that a lot of my acne has gone down which is nice and the fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth are plumping up quite nicely I would have ranked it five stars if it wasnt so drying and if it wasnt so YELLOW It completely stains my face Once I put my moisturizer on it isnt so bad but theres still a stark ring of yellow on the perimeter of my face and in my hairline Really annoying but since I only use it once a week its not the biggest deal\\nread more I would give this serum 5 stars and still be using it if I hadnt found something better thats also cheaper This serum is light and smooth works great under makeup and has a very light pleasant scent Im the person who cuts open makeup tubes and uses every last millimeter of everything and I was very impressed when I opened this up that there was literally nothing left in the container You get your moneys worth Ive tried most of the Algenist line and this and the probiotic mask are the only things Id recommend\\nread more Seemed ok but did not like the smell so returned this item I am not lying really it helpful sephora employed recommend me that it good for dray skin and for acne control so far it did work i used in the night time Pros texture wise beautifully sat on my face Very smooth soft and hydrated Worked well around the eye areas as well Cons It balled up when I applied my sunscreen and foundation on top I did wait for 10 minutes before applying my sunscreen though Also it hasnt lightened my freckles as suggested by the Sephora beauty advisor Verdict Itll work beautifully as an evening product Unfortunately Im mainly looking for a product for daytime use that doesnt ball up and can lighten my recent developed freckles Will definitely recommend this product for evening use\\nread more I am not totally convinced about the magic of algae but as far as hyaluronic acid serums go this one really does work for me My skins looks great when I use it well enough that Ive bought the full size a couple of times now So I was looking for the fine lines that were starting around my eyes and mouth I had some hyperpigmentation that lightened up and the small lines dont exist Im at in my early 30s but its nothing like early prevention Expected so much more Used for 3 weeks So I initially got this as a 100 point reward from Sephora and OH MY GOD I was HOOKED So I went back  got three more of the 100point sizes When I ran out of those I bought the full size And I know this sounds weird but I dont feel like the results from the full size were as great Note I was initially really put off by the recent but I ended up really liking the scent after awhile Im torn I actually like this serum goes on smooth and absorbs very quickly ready for a moisturizer But the smell Its horrific Its like chocolate had a really bad day and wasnt wearing deodorant 2 Months of diligent 1 pump daily morning use and my sunspots and light skin damage have not altered In fact my skin is worse SEE PHOTO PROOF I understand the Vitamin C and ingredients are meant to resurface the skin and this can cause light breakouts  but if you view my photo of before and after you can see visible current breakouts and MORE scarring damage caused by the ones I have had over the 2 months Some light zits became very problematic and even with careful care damaged skin that was clear before The small zitsskin irritation should outweigh the effectiveness BUT IT DOES NOT Proof is in the photos that my light sun damage under eyes and on cheek bones did not reduce or lighten at all Visible skin irritation and breakouts daily for 2 months is unacceptable for no results I wish I could get a refund on this product As it is I have to spend the next month repairing my skin in time for a family wedding Out 100 dollars and MORE skin damage Furious and heartbroken\\nread more This makes my skin feel supple and moisturized However it broke my neck out in acne I have five pimples on my neck right now and it isnt a cute look Side note I never get pimples anywhere other than on my face and even then its mild I received a 10 day sample of this product and noticed it gave my Skii Essence and Lancome Visionnaire Serum a remarkable boost within a week of use I have super sensitive skin and it has never made me break out I am on my third bottle now and I love the extra hydration that this product gives my skin which can be a difficult balance living in a state like Texas I love the smell and the way this product absorbs into my skin It does well under Too Faced Primed  Poreless Primer with BareMinerals makeup on top Overall I have noticed my skin appears smoother and more plump since I have added it to my morning beauty regimen\\nread more Not my favorite product I did not see any difference SKII ultimate Revival serum is much better It absorbs into the your skin very quickly and feels very silky It definitely moisture your skin but I cannot tell if it is preventing wrinkles or aging I think like all SKII products it will improves the overall quality of your skin but not necessarily targeting wrinkle or aging Its heavily perfumed and gave me a headache Returned it after one use Too bad I loved SKIIs original serum It made my extra large pores just the tiniest bit smaller This new serum is not as effective It doesnt do much for my pores Its also heavier What this serum does do a better job at is calming the redness in my skin and keeping it hydrated I generally use this at night bc when I use it during the day it leaves my oily tzone a little bit more shiny I tried this though I have comboily skin It did not shrink my pores  I came home looking too shiney I need something more matte This did not work for me I used this serum day and night for a month straight I applied one dropper full to my face after washing and toning after two days I noticed my face felt smoother After two weeks I noticed my skin had more elasticity and fewer fine lines It didnt erase my pores pretty sure thats not possible It did however minimize them giving me fewer blackheads Around week three of using it I had a facial My esthetician commented on how good my skin looked For me this one is a winner I received the product for free from SKII\\nread more i used this product for about a month It is moisturizing and helped with the dry skin especially around the chin area Did not notice any dramatic difference in the firmness or minimizing the appearance of my pores I have been using this for over a month now since receiving a complimentary bottle Ive noticed my appear smoother and softer My face just looks happier My only concern is the pricebut I think the results are very good and may be worth the investment You dont have to use a lot of the product so you can make it last Plus it really moisturizes the skin so youll notice less dry spots I enjoy the consistency of the product it hidrates and my skin feels soft after I give it 4 stars as I do not see any improvements in lines and is very pricy for the results Disappointed when order arrived the jar was only half full so not much cream for the money paid As for results  I dont see any significant change to my skin but I only use it at night so maybe this is the reason I like Perricone treatments serums especially but Im not sure if this cream is worth the money it costs Let me preface by saying I have been using Perricone Products for about 20 yrs and they comprise a good share of my skin regiment I thought this would add additional hydration for me I noticed the first time I used it my skin was burning and turned red but calmed down after awhile I do have sensitive skin and need to be careful with new products After using about 2 days my face broke out in red irritated bumps which a few of his masks have done to me in the past I stopped anything I had not been using for some time had to stop my actives and waited until skin cleared to reintroduce again After the bumps cleared up my skin was so dry you could see flakes I confirmed with Perricone customer service on when to apply and was told after serums and before moisturizer Same thing occurred I tried once more and that was it there is something in this that doesnt agree with my skin He mentions the Rosemary as a major ingredient which is a known irritant yet it is listed so far down the ingredient list that it is doubtful that caused the problem It sounds like others are having good results but I will look for another Hyaluronic product to augment my skincare\\nread more I have been using Perricone for the last 25 years and my skin just love it but yesterday I purchased this cream to try and woke up this morning with the worst red itchy rash i ever encounter I never wrote a bad review for this skin care they are my fave but this cream was back to the store this morning and i got my finishing moisturizer back I also think the price is high for this 1oz jar I have to be honest i did stop for about one year because of prices but nothing came close to this line am retired and trying to make my jars and tubes last longer\\nread more While this moisturizer is quite luxe I found that it wasnt great to wear during the day under makeup as it balled up It was also wasnt as moisturizing as Id hoped  I had some flakiness through the day I totally love the cold plasma by Dr Perricone but this for me is nothing special I get better moisture from other less expensive brands It is again for me not worth the price Youll be surprised how small this container is when you receive it The product worked but by no means did it perform any miracles I feel I can find just as good of a product for a fraction of this price I will continue the search for a perfect moisturizer Ive been searching high and low for a moisturizer that can combat the dry flaky skin Ive developed over the last few years trying upwards of 20 different brands formulations ingredients etc and THIS one actually works After 2 months of use my skin is hydrated has a more even tone is firmer and overall looks better than it has in years The major downside is the price 70 for 1oz of product is ridiculous I am repurchasing but will continue my hunt for something comparable at a better value\\nread more My skin is super dry Literally instantly absorbs any moisturizer I use The first few times I used this I didnt really notice any difference We have suddenly had a cold snap and I noticed it overnight My skin was less flaky and seemed to stay hydrated Last year I used face oil but this winter I will be using this product I received a jar of this to review I was super excited to try this moisturizer provided to me from influenster This is a Great moisturizer It is a little too heavy for me to use in the summer It is a great winter moisturizer I wasnt crazy about how it felt after I put it on It was a little thicker than I liked I used it before bedtime and that worked well for me I have been using this product for a couple of weeks I enjoy the smell of it  and now that the cold weather is here  my skin gets more dry I have noticed it is helping me with keeping it moisturized I dont know if Ive noticed a huge difference in my skin but I still like it  because it doesnt go on too thick and I dont feel my skin getting dry throughout the day I did receive this product free for testing purposes  but I will buy it in the future\\nread more I received this from Influenster to try for free This would be a splurge item for me after using it I would definitely think about doing just that I liked how moisturized my face seems while using it When my skin is dry it starts to look like I have larger pores I dont but to me that is the appearance This keeps my skin plump and soft looking I received a complementary sample of this product and courtesy of Influenster and Vox Box I am usually cautious when purchasing moisturizers because of sensitive skin Skin care products can be expensive and it is trial and error to find something that works well for my skin I really wanted to test the product out and give it an extensive trail being that I received it as a promotional sample my skin has dry patches and its very hard for me to find products that work and not cause a reaction This product actually does well I didnt break out after using it I used the product over a few weeks My skin felt smooth and moisturized I didnt notice much improvement over my fine lines however I did show some brightening and my complexion The products did you sing a bit at various times which is why I took off the star That couldve been because of my sensitive skin I can see myself using this product in the winter mostly wear my skin is more dehydrated It never left my skin greasy I would consider purchasing this after I run out\\nread more I liked this moisturizer but I didnt love it It did keep my skin hydrated and less oily but thats about it I didnt see any difference in my fine lines or dullness in my skin Its just not worth the prize I can get a drugstore night cream that would do pretty much the same thing I received this product complimentary from Influenster for review purposes I received this product through Influenster to try and was excited to try it Dr Perricone is known for their clinical strength products and this was no different I am an oily skin with concerns of aging This product is a gel cream texture and in the summer when I first tried it it was a bit heavy for my oily skin liking Now that the weather is turning colder I do find that I like it a lot better If you are dry you will love this product as its still pretty moisturizing despite the gel texture I found that after a while of using it my skin was plumper and firmer I also find this product is great as a primer Hold my foundation beautifully Would recommend this to all skin types\\nread more This is a great moisturizer for dry skin I have combination skin so I found it to be too much for me It doesnt feel heavy when applied and soaks right into the skin I would recommend this for people with drier skin I received this product for free so I could review it I really like how light this moisturizer is and how it makes my skin feel smooth I am not a fan of the smell however Just a little dab goes a long way I received this product complimentary for testing purposes I was very excited to try this product after the Sephora employee recommended it to me for my acne scars When I started using this product I had little to no visible acne After using it for several days I have developed painful acne all over my forehead I will definitely be returning this product I was so excited about this specifically from the reviews Unfortunately I am not a fan Didnt see any difference in over 3 months Would like to return but dont have the box any longer I have so many acne marks on my forehead and I was really excited to try this product hoping it would make the texture of my skin better but it didnt work for me it didnt do anything at all and I used it as instructed Hated the applicator difficult to get product out and apply into the skin No difference in the appearance of my scar after consistent use I literally used the whole product over time and nothing happened Super disappointed  Did absolutely nothing Use everyday on a very small scar until the bottle was used up several months later My thennew shallow scar remains as brilliant as the day I started The good reviews seem very suspect in hindsight Its a good product just started using it no visible changes but will keep using it Super sad because I was hoping this product would work miracles for me based off the reviews I read I definitely havent used it long enough to see any improvements in my acne scars but I find that this product is making me break out more than before I was using it I am not sure if I should be using it since I still have active acne too I try to avoid my areas of active acne and just apply to the areas with the scars but I get the feeling the rollerball accidentally touches the acne and then is spreading the bacteria around the different parts of my face I will probably return and try something from another brand\\nread more Been using as directed for months I actually broke out even more with this product and my acne scars are still there Ive gotten bumps all over my forehead and they wont go away now Since Ive stopped using this product Im seeing improvement I couldnt really tell a difference after using most the tube in combination with dermarolling I also felt like the rollerball was unnecessary for acne scars and didnt allow for the product to absorb Did not work for me and made my acne worse I dont think its a good idea for anyone with acne to use this product or any rollerball product because the acne spreads through the rollerball I love this product it really does work at slowly getting rid of old acne scars HOWEVER Ive noticed Ive been getting new acne right next to the old scar that Ive been putting the serum on I dont think its a coincidence since this has happened 3 times now I have fairly sensitive skin so if you dont have sensitive skin then I would definitely recommend this product If youre prone to acne like me and have super sensitive skin be warned\\nread more Face peeled Dry patches My skin isnt sensitive at all and its a recurring issue it seems with this product I am 63 years old and found this to be too harsh on my skin Used 3 x first week then cute down to only once a week and still to much peeling Not worth the price I love Kate Somerville and I wanted to love this product but I dont I prefer the first aid radiance beauty pads I wanted to return this serum but it was outside my return time I received this product complimentary to try and thought it was okay I use a vitamin c serum every am and retinol at night so I was really excited to try one product with both in it I feel like the month I used it my skin regressed a little I think the other two serums are more potent but my smile likes worsened and skin was as bright When I went back to my other products both Sunday Riley my skin improved and went

advices 1 AVOID USING THIS PRODUCT ARIUND YOUR EYE AREA 2USE VERY LITTLE AMOUNT with lots and lots of moisturizer on top I messed up and forgot to not to put it around my eye area and theyre all burnt

product does make a difference However if you do not follow the instruction youll end up with a burnt skin\\nread more This stuff smells amazing Like fresh citrus orange heavenlyness I have noticed a big difference in acne scarring and my skin being brighter since I started using it I took off one star because I dont think the effect is extreme enough to justify the high price but it definitely helps what I was looking to address on my skin I will likely buy it again when I have a coupon This serum sounds like it would be amazing because its a three in one with retinol vitamin c and hyaluronic acid in the one serum I was REALLY excited for this because of that reason but it broke me out after I used it for two weeks Lots of bumps and rough texture on my cheeks some painful pimples around my mouth and jawline I have quite sensitive and dry skin so perhaps this was just too harsh and irritating Hoping to return this\\nread more Echoing other reviewers regarding the potency of this formula I have never had a negative reaction to retinol but burned my skin within three days of adding this one to my regimen I am backing off to 12 nights per week and anticipate getting great results I do think the packaging could make the risks a bit more clear though as could Sephora associates when recommending this product This is the first retinol product Ive used consistently and love it Im on my second bottle Definitely noticed a difference and to me its worth the price It has helped with my dark spots and Ive been very careful to use sunscreen while using the product My skin can be sensitive and I had no reaction to this My main skin concerns are dark spots dullness and fine lines and this serum is transforming my skin Ive only been using this nightly for 23 weeks and already noticing my stubborn melasma fading and my complexion is coming back to life I havent experienced the dryness and irritation others reported The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the scent is very offputting theres a hint of citrus but I can only describe it as lemon yogurt and I sort of have to brace myself before applying it\\nread more After one night of use it does smooth some tiny wrinkles magically but the smell is 100 not acceptable It smells like old shoes which makes the application not very pleasing In all honesty I cant give the efficacy of this product a true review because I havent made it that far I am really disappointed with this product upon my first use because the 2nd ingredient is Dimethicone Since this indicates its for evening use only I put it on directly after my toner as I tend to like to use my actives as close to the skin as is possible However because this is so loaded with silicone nothing will layer nicely over it and I ended up with it pilling terribly when I tried to moisturize over it Silicone DOES NOT belong in night time skincare I dont need a silky smooth feeling before I go to bed Under makeup Heck yeah But if I cant use an oil and cream overtop of this it completely defeats the purpose for me Im sad I wasted a promo code to get this and I most certainly wont be buying the full size Kate you can do better\\nread more This made me break out I should have read the ingredient list more carefully Been using this product for about 2 months overall I think its okay I havent noticed any difference I use this for night time only followed by the YouthRenewing Power Night Cream It does leave my face feel soft afterwards but thats about it Nothing special I used this for a month and didnt see any difference with the reduction of fine lines This is not made for combination or acne prone skin I usually have a couple new pimples a week but within 2 weeks of using this I was getting clogged pores all over my face in places I never had problems before Not for acne prone skin This was highly recommended by a coworker but silly me for not reading the reviews before purchasing 2 blemishes in 2 days One of them is a cystic acne Not worth it imo Hydrating but didnt notice any of the anti aging properties it claims to have Great serum and very light Eh texture is ok not too greasy but I didnt think it did anything I havent had luck with the mushroom ingredients I dont see a big difference in my skin specifically my pores when I use them I received a 05 fl oz sample which lasted about 3 weeks TEXTURE lightweight but nourishing sinks into skin quickly nongreasy leaves smooth finish suitable for all skin types INGREDIENTS LONG list including a lot of plant extracts score of 3 from EWG moderate hazard Love the smell and texture of the product has an overall nice and hydrating feel to it Not too heavy for oily skin However dont think Ill repurchase again Didnt really deliver what it promises Love the serum Only complaint is I wish it came in a bigger bottle This product is smooth and light on my skin while still helping me retain moisture I cant speak for the antiaging properties because that wasnt really one of my concerns Its a little pricey but other than that this is a great product only tested a sample but its not for me I just cant get over the potent grandmas perfume smell just too much for my nose to handle This product did plump fine lines it didnt diminish them but I did notice an improvement Im 40 and have filler in a few spots on my lower face to combat collagen loss and skin laxity and I will say the product drew water to the filler making it more plump in those areas with filler it is cosmetically elegant feels nice during application and has a gel like consistency 4 stars because of the fragrance its very perfumey get rid of the fragrance it does nothing for the skin its actually an irritant and degrades the actives in products The price tag at 122 Canadian is quite steep imo\\nread more The product itself is very nice goes on and absorbs well My skin looks great Unfortunately the scent is overwhelming If not for the smell I would have happily given 45 stars Did absolutely nothing for me It doesnt even moisturize my skin still feels dry after Not worth the money at all Would not recommend Very heavily scented and if you take apart the bottle its 75 packaging and 25 actual product Looks bigger than it is so i was shocked when I was done the bottle so quickly Not worth the extremely high price Do not buy Made my skin worst My skin has never been so bad I have large pimples that I never dealt with I originally bought this for small zits while on my period but now Im suffering with horrible skin I dont notice a huge difference between this and cheaper retinol products It seems to work on my breakouts but does little to nothing on scarring I dont think it is worth the price The product itself is fantastic But I hate the packaging The bottle is white opaque plastic I cant tell when its running out and its very frustrating Definitely a great new goto product Helps eliminate redness from the hormonal acne and reduces the total area of breakout Also helps keeps oils down Doesnt totally clear out my skin but this has become part of my daily regimen I decided to give this a try instead of my usual Murad Acne Clearing Solution Huge mistake I got through half the bottle and just had to give up This stuff irritated my skin like you wouldnt believe I had endless breakouts to the point where I practically didnt want to leave the house I stopped using it almost two weeks ago and my skin is just now starting to clear up It might work better for someone that doesnt have sensitive skin but for me it was just too much\\nread more Im in my late 20s and suffered from really bad hormonal acne and cystic acne for about 5 years all along my jawline chin and cheeks I use this and Dermadoctors aint misbehavin cleanser and its been the only thing thats worked I use this stuff twice daily under my moisturizer and it is AMAZING Cleared up my acne completely in under a month and kept in controlled Now my oncemonthly flare ups are just a pimple or two Huuuuge improvement to what it was I dont think it does much for my wrinkles but thats not why I purchased it\\nread more Ive been using this product since August and repurchased my second bottle recently It definitely is an acne and wrinkle reducer I suffer from small bumps under my skin and occasionally the very skindeep pimple that takes a while to reach the surface of my skin This just reduces the size but dont expect this to completely get rid of your acne For first time users I would put on a small area before you lather your entire face with it as it can be a bit drying Helps with the fine lines around my eyes and smile lines \\nread more I will never buy this product ever again Not only is it expensive but I didnt work for me at all It made my skin worse I only applied it on my forehead and chin area since that was were I was breaking out and not only did it make me breakout worse but it clogged my pores terribly I had terrible bumps all over my forehead and chin area Once I stopped using the product my skin got better Returning it Since I started using this Ive noticed my skin clear up so much Only issue I had was I didnt realize at first how thin the pads were and threw out a couple extra at first Not impressed I have not really noticed a difference in my skin from using these I wasnt super impressed by this product The pads dont really smell like anything and dont give my skin a good burn or tingle so I cant tell if the salicylic acid is working Will probably not repurchase I was hoping this would clear my hormonal acne but didnt notice a difference Still had the acne after using the whole tub Possible the salicylic acid doesnt work for me since Ive used other products with it and havent seen a difference Their facial radiance pads are much better I recommend you purchase them instead These pads didnt do anything to clear my existing acne mostly blackheads and 1 or 2 tiny whiteheads While using them I got the biggest whitehead I believe Ive ever had I thought they were supposed to clear and prevent acne but did just the opposite I didnt even finish them because I could feel my skin getting worse and worse I loved the original formula of this product and bought it monthly I never had to worry about breakouts as long as I had them However with the addition of salicylic acid in the new formula the pads are much too strong and over dry my skin causing rough patches and an overproduction of oil that has caused my skin to breakout like crazy I gave them two months to work but they really are too much for my sensitive skin Ive switched over to the facial radiance pads and they seem to be helping with the mess this product has caused in my skin If you have uber sensitive skin like me I would stay away\\nread more Okay so I bought this product because Ive never had a retinolretinoid before and Susan Yara from Mixed Makeup recommended this specific product I love me some Susan so I bought the product I am NOT a fan I opened the bottle and was blasted with fragrance Likethis stuff is POTENT I dont like having any fragrance on my skin because Im acneprone and slightly sensitive I probably should have read the ingredients closer than just trusting Susan lol Smells horrifically synthetic and Im honestly anxious to put this stuff on my skin I used it for a few weeks before getting a prescription for differin cream I didnt notice any difference while using it but my skin definitely didnt improve Im sure this product is great for a lot of people but I am not one of those people Unfortunate that it is branded as clean when Ive honestly never owned a product that smells so fake\\nread more Love this product Only a few drops is needed and the bottle lasts a long time You only need so little and it dries quickly so its not sticky at all I use it under my sunscreen and its perfect for those cold and dry winter m months I have combination skin Asian skin aged 33 acne prone and sun damage This felt nice on my skin gives a little tingle I definitely purged when I started using this in the first couple weeks but it has since minimized and I havent had more or less breakouts Not sure it made a huge difference in my skin Havent compared it to a true retinol So far so good Ive used it for a few weeks my skin looks with less pigmentation and looks glowy in the morning I had been using a retinol product to help with my hormonal acne but had been noticing that it was causing some hyperpigmentation on my cheeks After using up that product I thought Id try this to give my skin a break Regret it It did help with the hyperpigmentation during those two weeks and it smells incredible I usually avoid all scented products but this was delightful and I will miss it but my acne came back with a vengeance If you have hormonal acne and are looking for a retinol alternative unfortunately this is not the product for you It does work well for the hyperpigmentation\\nread more It smells nice like peachapricot On my face it dries out my skin and has caused a lot of acne On my body scars Im waiting to see if it makes even a little improvement but Ive been using it consistently for two weeks and Im feeling disappointed I really wanted to like this and I dont doubt that its a good product but I did break out A LOT while using this I read the reviews and saw other people did as well but I gave it the benefit of the doubt because I really wanted to try it If you have sensitive skin at all I would not reccommend this product I ended up returning it which bummed me out Its ok Not my favorite Probably great for someone just starting out with retinoids though I really like the light scent of this product I pat it on on top of my night serumcreameye routine My face feels slightly oily when I go to bed but when I wake up its perfectly moisturized and ready to be washed and tackle my day routine Ive been using this for the last month and I have not suffered any dry winter skin at all Its a bit pricey but a little goes a long way and I love a gentle retinol product This is a good addition to your nighttime ritual if youre serious about fighting signs of aging I find this product misleading because the title says Retinoid but the ingredients listed on Sephora does not contain the ingredient Also most of the oils used are comedogenic which clog the pores and does not allow the product to sink into the skin Worst of all the product contains parfum not essential oils I think I will pass on this product Gave it so many chances I really wanted to believe in it Ren was the first lotion I found that didnt break me out But this product gave me the worse pimple party ever Feels good Dries quickly Smells good Helped with one hyperpigmentationpost acne scar when i first use it but after that its barely doing anything Like it just made a good impression but that good impression did not last I use it morning and night and only have 14 left of the bottle Will not buy again No instant results as advertised not that I was expecting any But there are less expensive products out there that work just as well I was hoping that this would fade the spots faster but it doesnt 2 weeks already and didnt notice any change FYI dont like the smell of it I loved this My skin felt amazing just after a few applications Loved the product but vitamin c isnt as strong when is exposed to air and the packaging is awful for the price Bought 2 and both times my dropper was falling apart Returned product If packaging was more vitamin c friendly would definitely repurchase But your paying a lot for a product that is degrading due to packaging I really wanted to love this product but the rosemary scent is so overwhelming to me it gives me a headache Ive only recently stared using this product it seems to work well I havent fully seen any long lasting results just yet but I do feel that I need to be consistent on using it for A longer period of time so see some good results so Im going to keep using it I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes I always wanted to try this product but it is very costly for the amount you get I recently had the opportunity to try it when I received this product for testing purposes It felt beautiful on my skin but I didnt see the results I was looking for plus it comes out of the dropper very fast so be careful Ehhhhh I wanted to like this product but I wasnt blown away by the results because I didnt notice any Its an expensive product but I think another brand does a better job I received this gift complimentary in exchange for my honest review While I liked the product overall I found that it dried my skin out if I used it daily I would need to alternate it to every other day to avoid this The product lasts a long time even though its in small packaging I received the item FREE from Influenster to review I did not expect much from this product at first as I do not have any dark circles but I am here to tell you it does soo much more than brighten eyes I started using it and after about 2 weeks I noticed a big difference in the skin around my eyes it had really smoothed the skin and it did not feel crepey I am now using it around the corners of my lips also And the smell os amazing  so fresh I received Perricone MD Vitamin C Ester Brightening Serum for review from influenster but I will be adding this to my Christmas wishlist\\nread more I love Dior makeup but I have has burning around my eyes with the one essential eye cream I purchase before and had to return it to Sephora However I have decided to keep this one essential skin boosting serum but not anymore I am having the same issues which I taught was because of hot summer days or dryness due to the heat in the winter none of those I apply it in the night and when I get up in the morning I am still experiencing the same burning around my eyes\\nread more Other than slightly reducing the redness around my nose this serum was way overpriced for the lack of any significant results I would not recommend and will not be buying again Also should have just returned it Ive been using it since the first week of August and to be honest I havent noticed any changes good or bad my skin does not look better or worse because of this serum so no I wouldnt buy it again not worth it Responding to previous post please dont use toner after any serum Thats probably why its not working for you Cleanse tone serums moisturizer primer makeup then spf Hope this helps Dont use this if you have combinationoily skin or if you are prone to breaking out I was so surprised and really wanted to love this Ive used the other Dior serums without a problem I love the way this serum feels but it broke me out so bad And I dont usually break out from products I try new products every so often I cut this out of my daily routine and my skin started clearing up I loved this product until I figured out it was breaking out my cheek area This serum feels very light and feels great on the skin Someone with less sensitive skin would love it This stuff is a major disappointment so far The reviews are all super but the serum is not For the very high price of a one ounce bottle I expected at least some results after a few weeks No miracles of course but something Anything I always regret straying from my standard CaudaliePTR regimen This serum is sticky and stays that way All day or night STICKY I live near a large polluted city on the East Coast so with Diors magical claims of detoxifying and protecting skin from external aggressors like pollution I at least expected a very clean feeling to my skin But in the several weeks that I used it two times daily my skin got noticeably worse I am over 50 but have pretty good skin Just fighting the age with fine lines larger pores and a bit of leftover sun damage But when I used the Dior serum my skin actually broke out with cheek acne Havent seen that in 40 years I flipped my vanity mirror to Magnify and was dismayed to see that it looked like my skin was sort of disintegrating THAT has never happened to me I guess fear of aging will make you do stupid things like pay 100 for one ounce of something you havent sampled before It makes me feel even worse that this is sort of a preserum serumit was almost bound to fail Once again I kept the faith and kept using it to give it a chance so now I likely cant return it I gave this 2 stars strictly for the excellent packaging Dark heavy glass bottle nice smoothaction pump secure lid When an expensive designer skincare product makes your skin worse than its ever been you know it is definitely not the ONE\\nread more This is more like a primer than a serum I Applied it one night and when I woke up my skin looked dry and my texture skin was showing more than ever I was so excited when I saw all the reviews online  But didnt notice any change in my pores for 2 months  worked more like moisturizer for me So  no not worth it  It only helps a little mattigying but does nothing with the pores size I bought this years ago but havent been reaching for it very often This product is packed with silicone it makes sense because it focuses on pore minimizing although temporary but it does not do much of anything else which is why I dont find it ideal as a serum HOWEVER I recently started using it again by mixing it with moisturizers or sunscreens and then I got a great primer The end product effectively fills my pores while providing other benefits from products that I already know would work But still 3 stars because 1 doesnt work for me as a serum 2a bit pricey as a primer\\nread more This really did nothing for my pores I went through most of the bottle but didnt notice a difference I was really hoping this product would live up to some of the rave reviews it has but it didnt unfortunately  I ended up returning it because for the price I could get something that actually made a difference in my skin This stuff doesnt actually help make pores physically smaller it acts like a primer to put a layer of silicons over your pores which makes them look smoother However once you watch it off I found they were the same as before if not worse My pores on my nose got clogged when I used this and whiteheads developed which never happens to me even with regular primers I also found it was hard to wash off for several days after I first started using it my pores were looking smoother after I washed my face and I thought wow this stuff is really working Then I started breaking out and did a strong exfoliating scrub and mask to clear up the whiteheads When I rinsed the scrub off I noticed pilling was happening  which was weird because my skin should have been totally clean at that point I realized it was this product still on my skin after an aggressive scrub I finished scrubbing it off and realized that it had been on my skin all week though multiple face washes and make up removers after I finished removed it I realized my pores were not improved at all they were the same\\nread more Dont waste your money this doesnt work i did use this for 6 months and no results besides that if you layer another product over this one it will be a total mess The 1st time I try Estée Lauder products and I like this one I love the smell and the smooth feeling of my face after I apply it Not sure if it really minimizes my pores since Im using cleansers masks toners creams serums of different brands at the same time But still love it my skin is better anyway Ive been using this for several months and have only seen minimal differences in my skin I do feel like the pores on my cheeks have shrunk somewhat but not as much as I had hoped What I dislike most about this product is the oily residue it leaves behind My skin is already oily so this just adds to the problem Im glad I tried it but I wont be buying again Did not see any changes in the appearance of my pores skin texture or skin General This refinisher doesnt minimize your pores but it creates a mask full of silicons on your skin so it cant breath It doesnt clog pores though I guess it can be used as a make up primer but used alone as itself it does nothing to pores neither has good benefits like antioxidants and etc for your skin I loved this as my primer Shouldve used it after my face wash before moisturizer before bed That was when I noticed an actual difference with my skin The only reason this wont get 5 stars is because its so pricey I use this every night after hyaluronic Acid and before my eye cream and have had no issues with sensitivity Its not greasy and packed with everything you want in a wrinkle fighter It would probably be fantastic for mature skin this one was just a tad heavy for me I love Algenist products and this is one of the reasons why This smells fantastic its actually the only product that my boyfriend has ever commented on he lives the scent too Im not much of an oil person because it makes me look super shiny and most of them seem to cause me to break out This locks in moisture like an oil but doesnt make me look or feel greasy and hasnt caused any breakouts My skin feels soft the next day even if I cant attribute any visible results to the product It is pricey but it lasts a very long time Still I prefer to buy it during the vip sale\\nread more Im very ambivalent about this product  I bought the full size and have been using it for 56 months on a daily basis I used it as a moisturizer However I found it just sat on top of my skin and never absorbed It left my face very greasy to touch even after 1520 mins It also irritated my skin somewhat every time I applied itmaybe the antiaging product is supposed to cause tingling I dont notice much difference in my skin tone after each use However my skin does appear to be firmer in the morning  not sure if it has to do with this particular product\\nread more I used this product as the 2nd to last step in my evening skincare routine I love the light fresh but warm smell I think it added hydration and helped repair skin over night I never used the product by itself I purchased this at a discounted price and will not repurchaseI think there are other great products for a fraction of the price I can tell when a night cream or serum or moisturizer works when I wake up and my skin looks plump and bright or even better both I didnt see any difference with this and the formula does not absorb well or feel nice I mix this with my favorite serums in the morning It doesnt smell or leave the sticky feeling like the DE CFirma So far so good Havent noticed any drastic improvements in the few weeks that Ive been using it but I will continue to use it because Im a sucker for skincare products This is my second bottle I purchased I love the fact that I can mix it with anything moisturizer sunscreen etc but the reason for 4 stars is it can be messy dealing with the powder and the small spoon I have been using this for awhile now and have noticed no improvement whatsoever On the plus side it didnt irritate my sensitive skin Wont be buying again I like this powder but I am not sure if its better than cheap Lasorbic powder Its definitely a better choice than most unstable vitamin c serum I did not like this product It is difficult to use and I saw no results after extended use This works great added to any face oil to add vitamin C to your skin care regimen This is a great product and blends easily with most of my moisturizers I have an oily tzone and my AM routine consists of oilfreematte finish products I only gave this item a 4 out of 5 because I can not utilize it on long days where I want to be shine free When using this product I tend to get shiny after 46 hours of wear so I steer clear from this product on event days weddings etc Other than that its great for daily use and it does have a slight tinglingbrightening effect\\nread more Tried this with high expectations but it just didnt do much for my skin I have combo skin and occasional acne breakouts that leave me with dark marks I had hoped this would help but the vitamin c was too gentle and after an entire bottle I didnt notice a difference Maybe I just got a bad bottle If you have similar skin to me combo with some acne scarring I would try the Murad Invisiscar treatment which has made a really big difference evening out and improving my skin tone as well as helping to fade my scars Back to the Truth Serum product at the very least it added a little hydration but also gave me a couple small pimples\\nread more It absorbs super quick so you dont have to fan for minutes so you can apply your moisturizer It smells really lovely just like the eye cream I own as well I havent been using it very long so cannot comment just yet on the effects but from the week so far nothing negative to say and I have not broken out and my rosacia cheeks have no flared up so I am thinking that is a bonus Having used numerous vitamin C products in the past skinceuticals drunk elephant drdennis gross etc this serum is a very gentle inoffensive product that no doubt will work beautifully with sensitive skin or for people who are new to vitamin C That being said this was personally too gentle for me and I did not see any changes to my skin However I also did not break out or react adversely to this product so perhaps this is an issue of my own skin needing a bit more oomph Also Ole is not the only brand guilty of promoting this but collagen molecules are simply too large to be absorbed via the skin so do take any topical collagen claims with a grain of salt If you are looking to boost your own collagen production consider taking collagen supplements orally instead and not relying on a skincare products claims to do so\\nread more An extra skincare step with no results I love my skincare routine and trying out new products I have been trying out vitamin C based serums and have this famous one a try I genuinely saw no difference It felt super watery going on and like I always got too much product out I saw no brightness to my skin with this I did not enjoy this product and found myself missing the previous vitamin C serum I was using\\nread more Saw no difference in my skins appearance from using this And I used it every day until it was used up The smell and texture are great but it just did not work for me or my skin Use to be one of my holy grails I used it almost everyday for almost two years Back then my skin was better than it is now so maybe the serum had something to do with it As of now I only dont repurchase because I cannot afford it anymore I do miss it tho This product is amazing I had the perk facial and the technician recommended it I used it every night for 30 days My skin was clear and smooth always fresh As for wrinkles I couldnt tell you if this really reduces wrinkles or any product for that matter but with this my skin was always clean feeling bright and smooth I tried the wipes for the first time and was not happy  My skin reacted to the point it was burning and stinging After rinsing with water then my usual oil based cleanser I still have patches of rough red skin on my face Very noticeable and very uncomfortable Would not recommend I bought this product in store and when I opened the box there was a few peels that inside didnt have the peels and that was one thing but the next thing was I was sold a product WITH MOLD As you can see below in the videos and pictures I contacted Sephora and they didnt care at all and didnt compensate or help me in anyway Im really disappointed that Sephora would sell me and maybe even a different customer not only a damaged product but a product with MOLD Please be careful ladies and check before purchasing Definitely re thinking of to continue to a be a rouge I received horrible customer service and nothing was done\\nread more I used these for 2 months and wanted to love them so badly because I really like Dr Dennis Gross but they made my skin break out so much  I didnt really notice any long term benefits but I did start to get small bumps on my forehead after using this Ive had them before and they cleared up with drunk elephant glycolic acid serum I wanted to use something different that addressed this fine line Ive had on my forehead I didnt notice any improvement in that It does smell nice though and I like the consistency The smell is what I dislike the most I feel it doesnt do much for my skin and I do not understand the price point This makes my face so shiny Ive been using it for several months now and switched from day to overnight use recently after reading other reviews It seems to have improved the situation I want to throw it out but have only used half of the product and cant justify throwing away something so expensive Fingers crossed that overnight use works better  but avoid this if you have shine in your tzone \\nread more So this is a real review of the product and not one of the false ones the company has been pushing out there through its employees Google it for the info A lot of these five stars are fake reviews I got this in my Ipsy box and it took me a while to try it When I did I didnt notice a single difference Since then Ive been using other serums that actually make a difference that I can noticeably see I used the entire container before giving up and switching to a better serum This is more like a lotion and I got nothing from it Given the price tag and information on fake reviews Im not liking this product or brand at all\\nread more they changed the formula on one of the best products in my routine soooo deeply saddened and upset will be retuning  Sunday Riley really messed up They CHANGED the formula of a product that was perfect I know that for a fact beI had been using it for three years Will not purchase again literally got a pimple in every spot i put this product on T zone very heavy product I have been buying this for years The one expensive thing I find myself always buying after I run out The most resent one I purchased is not the same as all the others Its a shame I think theyre going to lose a lot of loyal customers with a product this expensive why mess with a good thing Ill be returning it The full size is not the same product as the 7 day sample Its a great product but the sample size seems like it actually has active ingredients in it The full size is a lot of money for not even close to the same effect Bought this twice now full size its just not the same thing Not sure if its just this batch or if the entire product line is like this The sample size 7 day trial was phenomenal At the end of 2018 I used the 7 day challenge sample packs and I continued to keep trying to get more samples to use and it was great so smooth and glowy I then take a break for 10ish months before I bought a full size recently I dont know what happened Whenever I use the recent purchase I get new closed pimples on my cheek I take a break extract and heal I then try to use this again and again new closed comedones\\nread more I have used the Drunk Elephant Glycolic Night Serum and the Farmacy Honeymoon Glow Serum religiously for the past two years I recently ran out of both and decided to try this since I had it in a little sample size I got from a previous order The first night I used this my skin had a very strange reaction I have bumps all over my cheeks which I NEVER get any kind of bumps or breakouts on my cheeks If I ever break out its on my chin or forehead This is the only thing Ive changed up in my skincare routine When I came on here to give my review I couldnt believe the price It actually shocked me that this company thinks this product is worth this price Needless to say I will be going back to DE or Honeymoon Glow\\nread more okay let me start off by saying these work but not in the way you think or maybe i dont know i purchased these because out of nowhere i got problematic skin ive never struggled with acne before except for maybe 23 months when i was 18 so i purchase these and immediately saw what they do it opens the zit and whatever is inside sticks to the patch and when you peel it off all the gunk is there easy enough then comes the scabbing over process and whatnot to my dismay it leaves the zip RED and open so then you have to take care of that issue i used my last one two weeks ago and the old already healed zit is stilllll red and the patch almost leaves an impression on your skin that takes time to go away i put fake tan on where the patch was and you can see an outline of a circle from where it was placed again from two weeks ago and another from over a month now i find it really weird and i dont like how my blemishes stay obvious for weeks after when its whole purpose is to clear it quickly and easily 110 for me \\nread more I was really hoping these dots would work and they totally disappoint I had two big acne and I seriously used the entire 20 dots package and they never went away or even helped my acne at all So sad I used all of them so i cant remember I dont feel like these worked I put them on 2 nights in a row on the same blemish and it didnt get better These healing dots made my breakouts red and even worse looking when I woke up in the morning I tried it several times and it always looked worse the day after I dont recommend this product to anyone Works okay Worked great the first time I used them but as I used them more I saw no difference I recommend them for someone who has pimples with pus in them This is the best acne treatment product I have used Sulfur and tea tree products dry my skin out and take at least a week for the pimple to go down These stay on throughout the night and prevents me from picking more and I only have to use it once or twice for it to disappear However the do leave a ring around the area so make sure you wash your face throughly before applying makeup I made the mistake and later saw the mark Ive been jealous seeing other peoples results from cheaper products like corsx but this is worth the price because its actually worked for me and pulled all the gunk out\\nread more I truly WANT TO love this product But so far it is not doing wonders for mekeep my fingers crossed Used it on my new acne bump after one use it was smaller not gone but smaller I may or may not purchase again Its 20 for about 12 dots ok but not worth the money i purchased because the only moisturizer my sensitive winter dry skin likes is 80 I am desperate to find something more affordable and this sadly was not it I found it dis not help with dryness at all and my skin somehow felt more dry after use maybe I should not use serums I wont buy this again but for people with less sensitive dry skin it might be perfect I wanted to love this On the plus side the consistency and texture are nice However Ive been using this about a month and am finding my face still extremely dry I feel this firms my skin more than it hydrated and it can often burn when applied to extremely dry areas The smell is also not great Not worth the price and will be trying to return For over 2 years I had small bumpstexture on my forehead and it went away a few days after I started using this and it hasnt come back My skin still isnt perfect but I definitely notice a huge difference Would definitely reccomend if you struggle with skin texture This did not feel hydrating at all I have extremely dry skin and my face felt kind of tight when I would put this on Kind of drying and not seeing any skin improvements I bought this hoping it would help with my extra dry winter skin It didnt work enough to impress me I used this under my DE LaLa and I feel like it made that less effective My skin felt less moisturized when I used this I will just stick to the Lala in the future I apply this after my skin care serum as a moisturizer and I love the combo and makes your make up looks so beautiful like a slight natural glow not oily Absolutely not This product is NOT hydrating in any which way It quickly absorbs into the skin and leaves you feeling tight and dry again If you are struggling with any dryness dont waste your money This product is a joke Was looking for hydration this wasnt it DEs Marula Oil VitC Serum and TLC Serum are all more hydrating than this Will not purchase again I really like this serum it has so many good ingredients and is great for a hydration boost under face cream It has a nice consistency too However after a little over 1 month of use Ive noticed that my skin prefers the FAB ulta repair hydrating serum When using the FAB instead of this I experienced fewer breakouts and better hydration So bang for buck this isnt my favorite Its a nice luxury serum with many benefits I will probably finish using it but not repurchase\\nread more It is a good serum but I do think there are better ones out there I used a full bottle in a six month period my skin was okay looking I do not think this is a so called holy grail by any means I literally bought this a few years ago and it didnt do nothing literally I been using it for 4 years and hasnt done nothing I literally wasted 2600 on this for it to do nothing I kept buying to see if it will work maybe it takes time and it hasnt done nothing the Lancôme works better and I scutslly see results the Estée Lauder is basically a waste of money it goes on clear but dried sticky and doesnt do nothing much I been thinking it would do soemthing at lease since its so much but nope I was wrong I got my whole family mad at me because I told them about it and they been using it as well and it hasnt done nothing Im just like wow so Im done using this maybe it will work for you but not me or my family better off with Lancôme and or Clinique\\nread more This is an ok serum but I am just not into the hype of this product It is not very hydrating on dry skin  may be better for oily or normal skin This is pricey but the benefits I receive make it worthwhile I have been using it for over five years and it keeps my skin smooth and never dries it out Feeling comfortable using this My skin becomes softer Hydrating Just plain serum before moisturizer Not surprisingly good or bad Justgood good But for the price not worthy Ive been using this nightly for about six months now and follow up with a face lotion A friend raves about it and I was wanting to switch up my face care regiment so I gave it a try The oil is light and it dries quickly so thats a plus When I wake up my face always feels silky soft but other than that I cant tell any difference For the cost I wouldnt say its worth it I dont have many wrinkles and am only beginning to notice a few small lines I was hoping this would make the appearance of them less noticeable and after six months I cant tell a difference at all\\nread more A little brightness in the beginning maybe but not much difference at all after a 34 fl oz bottle was done What a waste Maybe these topicals cant help late 40s skin I feel like it worked however for the price the Ordinarys products are better and results are faster I did accurate to get rid of my acne this completely broke me out from head to toe Prob cause of the oils Not for sensitive or acne prone skin Not worth the hype and Im convinced theyve changed the formula as it didnt dry out my skin a few years ago best product ever now i buy it for the third time and i want to buy it more it was very recommended i got the trail pack of these and used them every 2 or 3 days and I was already receiving compliments on how nice my skin looks I have already purchased the 30 packet universal peel I cant wait to see what my skin looks and feels like in another few weeks These work SO well I received the small pack as a gift and saw a difference in my skin overnight Im just torn because I am trying to be kinder to the planet and the singleuse packaging is killing me Couldnt these be put into a recyclable jar instead of the packets Or better yet offer this product in a bottle so you can use your own biodegradable or reusable cotton rounds I love the formula of this product unfortunately I dont think I can bring myself to purchase it simply because of the packaging It seems so unnecessary This would have been a 5star review if the packaging were less wasteful\\nread more I read the reviews and was really hopeful but didnt work for my skin I get burning sensation when I use it and gets worse after My skin brightened right up after one use I went hard and used three days in a row and felt super glowy Now I try to do three days a week Four stars because the wipespads are not eco friendly  I ordered these during the VIB Holiday Sale after having several girlfriends tell me they were great I used them for 6 days treatments  as of last night the right side of my face is completely broken out with tiny red bumps all over my forehead cheeks and chin I have never been prone to breakouts other than the occasional pimple here and there These tiny red bumps are under the skin and look awful I am going to return them and hope to god that my skin returns to its normal state shortly\\nread more I was skeptical about this product but its actually awesome I wondered if it would be a peel treatment and its not which Im happy about Plus being a peel for everyday I worried about stripping my skin or just being too much for everyday and its not I have fine lines between my eyebrows and those are almost gone Its like I got Botox The texture on my face is a lot smoother Step 1 does have a hard smell when I did it the 1st time but after its fine Highly recommend this I will for sure but again\\nread more Super fragrant  oof  and not hydrating at all Have to layer many other products to prop this product up Definitely not effective for dry skin Another disappointment from La Mer As I have stated in other reviews they should stick to their signature lotionscreams because they are amazing This is no better than any drugstore toner I have used It is not hydrating despite its claims to be I used it for a week and just couldnt get over how not impressive it was Even the packaging was not good  the hole at the top is so tiny barely anything came out I had to make it larger with a safety pin just to get the liquid to come out more than one tiny drop at a time There is absolutely nothing about this product that justifies the price Nothing I will stick with May Coop Raw Sauce or SKII\\nread more I used to use this as my toneressence everyday for a few years I had my best skin ever One day I ran out and never replenished I decided to try something new However after a year without it I noticed my skin was not as subtle or plump looking without The Treatment Lotion my skin was starting to look more and more dull over time I decided to add this back into my routine Within two weeks of using it again my skin was starting to glow again Not only was my skin getting its glow back but my skin was looking plump again too Plumping up any tiny fine lines that had started to appear The texture of my skin was also starting to improve I dont know what I was thinking discontinuing this stuff Its amazing My favorite thing about it is how your skin feels the second you apply it As it states its like an instant rush of hydration Quenching any thirst your skin may be lacking with its fastabsorbing formula Also doing a great job soaking in your products to get the most effectiveness out of your serums and creams to follow I do doc one star while the ingredients are great the balance between the most valuable ingredients in it to me and the concentration of those ingredients become diluted down in the formula so it can be made toner or an essence making this a little over priced value to dollar BUT there is nothing quite like it or its formula or even how its Miracle Broth is made sooo its still a winner in my book Also For those who are really concerned about what they put on their skin this is formulated without Parabens Phthalates or Sulfates\\nread more I have mixed but dehydrated skin This is really hydrating and the best thing is this product smoothes your skin so nicely Not sticky at all nice scent and it ABSORBS REALLY QUICKLY So you dont have to wait long for other skin care routines I had one of those never ending deep zits that lasted 3 weeks I got a sample and applied it for 3 days and it flattened out and then top layer of skin shed and voila I heard this was invented to heal chemical burns Maybe urban legend maybe not Im convinced this may just be the tears of unicorns Minus one star for the insane price I think La Mer makes some of the best skincare products on the market and I had high hopes for this one mainly for uneven pigmentation and scaring but if fell short especially when considering the price tag Its the only La Mer product Ive ever returned Unfortunately I didnt see any difference in the way my skin looked Im glad I kept trying to find my perfect match though because their brightening line really did the trick for me\\nread more Bought this as a treat for myself at the holidays just to see whats so special but after a month it doesnt live up to all the hype and definitely not worth the price Its a nice enough syrum but Im back to my Shiseido so much more effective for me I did not notice a difference and I started to break out on my chin from this Not recommended I know not everything works for everyone so Im wary of holy grail type products but wow My skin has never been so clear and soft Ive never been someone who feels comfortable without a little makeup maybe some concealer and my brows at the least but Im definitely feeling a lot more comfortable in my bare skin now 1 star because the price point is insane but I will say that a little goes a long way so it softens the financial blow This was a game changer for me\\nread more My skin looks amazing with the combo of an acid toner and this baby on top The heartbreak comes with the silicone inside I get tons of compliments on my skin when I do this routine but silicones trap dirt clog pores and inhibit cell turnover Now that Im in my 40s I need all the turnover I can get This also helps boost the decolletage area if youre getting any sleep lines I received this for free directly from La Mer It made my skin feel very soft immediately after using it but thats about the only positive once it dries it gave my skin a very strange texture and it also made my skin break out It didnt seem to help with acne scars wrinkles or anything else the other reviewers are claiming The product itself is very watery and a lot of it went to waste unfortunately I tried to shake it gently before using but that didnt help either I got a bad product or this stuff is just very watery\\nread more This product is basically nothing but silicone Terrible I have never had acne in my life and just after a week of use I had acne all over face Makes you face look good but thats why people use silicone primers because they blur and make skin look good The results wash off and your skin looks not so great I dont think I have ever used a product that is so hyped that turned out to be the worst product I have ever used Sorry La Mer but Ill stick to my Drunk Elephant where the appearance of good skin doesnt wash off at the end of the day\\nread more Ive been using this religiously for the past month or two hoping id see some changes or even just less dry skin I was disappointed My skin maybe looks a little more hydrated but i still have pretty dry skin I love the creme de la mer but for me this is a pass especially at that price point I feel like there are other concentrate formulas from other brands that work better and for a quarter of the price Not impressed I received this as a sample and used it along with my normal products and the next morning my fave felt disgusting Super oily product and broke me out after just one use Dont recommend for oily skin this is essentially a bottle of silicone and gave me awful acne I do not have sensitive skin either I seen no improvement at all in my skin FIRST IMPRESSION I received a sample and used this for a week TEXTURE silky rich but lightweight on the skin and nourishing RESULTS this kept my skin relatively trouble free INGREDIENTS longgg list lots of plant extracts dimethicone is one of the main ingredients I was referred this product by a friend I use this with my Powerful Strength Line reducing concentrate DAY and NIGHT Let me start by saying that I have oilycombination skin Since Ive upgraded my skincare regimen I now have normalcombination I have severe hyperpigmentation from my teens and its worst around my chin and neck This product have changed my life The hyperpigmentation on my chin and neck have faded significantly over the past few months Please keep in mind this hyperpigmentation was extremely darker that my skin tone Although it is visibly there I see a major difference in fading You have to use this product DAY and NIGHT for this to work with SPF SPF 40 or higher Well thats for any product that is correcting dark spots Not only has this helped fade my dark spots but my face has gotten so much smoother as well I will be keeping this as a staple in my regimen\\nread more Have tried some lightening products for dark spots but this one doesnt work as well as the others It takes very long to see results Have just been using it to finish the bottle I prefer the murad rapid age serum US VERSION That product significantly helped with my dark hyperpigmentation I wanted so badly for this to work i used it consistently nightly it went on beautifully and felt hydrating but it didnt help fade my dark spots much i have olive skin and have found exfoliating acids more helpful I have been using this for over 5 weeks for hyperpigmentation and zero improvement If this were an effective treatment I would expect to see some kind of result after 5 weeks at 2x daily  even modest changes I will not be waiting another month and a half for some kind of marginal improvement that may or may not happen Disappointed This may be a little more affordable than some of the dark spot correctors out there but 70 bucks is still a lot to throw away on a whole lot of nothing Not to mention the diligence required to apply this stuff twice a day\\nread more I got this in hopes to help lighten and even my skin tones I used it for 9 months before I gave up I saw no difference using this product Did not work for me at all The manufacturer promise is the brightening of the pigment spots But the Serum doesnt contain any brightening components I started using Kiehls Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution in the summer of 2019 after a particularly bad breakout caused major scarring on my face I was looking for anything that would help and this was the only product I purchased that made a visible difference After 3 months of use the spots had faded significantly I stopped using the solution at that point but decided to reup this year when another bad breakout caused another round of really dark spots Ive only been using the solution again for about 2 months now and the difference is incredible My spots are on their way to being gone completely I recommend using this product after cleansing with Dr Bronners Pure Castile Soap in Peppermint and toning with Olehenriksen Glow2OH Dark Spot Toner for the perfect dark spot removal routine I only took away a star because it does take daily use and a bit of time to really see results with this product but its definitely worth the wait\\nread more No difference The lady at Sephora basically forced me to buy it Two months in I see no difference Never again I have used this product diligently and am more than halfway through the bottle and have seen no difference I wouldnt recommend it and will discontinue use Apply quite nice but used an entire bottle and did not do anything to my skin As a serum for hydration it works well my skin felt smooth But for spots treatment which is what it claims to do didnt work at all Zero difference and I used 2 bottles every day am and pm with their exfoliating soap from the same line Big disappointment I had a a dark spot on my forehead and it slowly started fading away I would sometimes used this product all over my face and at times directly at the darks spots on my face Hope to worked faster Ive been buying this serum on and off for about four years now and there is a noticeable difference in my skin when I stop using it I have oily combo skin that is prone to breakouts particularly along my jaw and continued use of this serum improves skin texture and clarity Im not saying it is a miracle worker for pimples but it certainly helps reduce the redness and then lightens the scarring afterwards To be fair I have not tried other products for dark spots but this has been working well for me regardless\\nread more It does lighten up my skin and erase dark spots but it makes me break out a little and breaking out means more dark spots I really enjoy the smell of this product Its a wonderful Lavender and it honestly makes my skin so soft I use this at night before my moisturizer Did not like it since it caused me to break out I have tried other similar products and they didnt irritate my skin Had to return it I really wanted this to work and help my sunspots Couldnt deal with the amount of breakouts to offset the possible benefits it supposedly promise In exchange I paid a little more for tatcha brighten serum So far so good And no breakouts Im very impressed with the results from the dark shot solution I started to see a change in my dark marks solution within two to three weeks I use the product two times per day I cant wait to see more results within the next month I wanted to love this but its making my skin break out like Im 13 years old again It also doesnt give me as much color as I anticipated Ive tried using this product many ways The only way that I like to use it is with an spf makes your face look super greasy and orange awful I really do like this for the no makeup days I mix it with my supergoop spf and it works wonders Only downfall is that it does tend to transfer  so it can get on clothing and on hands if you rub the area you applied Also a little goes a long way If you use too much you will look orange If you are wanting something with more coverage this is not it Its very sheer and will only add a nice bronze I had previously bought the tanning drops by isle of paradise but I found it always clogged my pores and would give me mini break outs So I figured Id try a company that seems to center itself around clean ingredients I dont know if I was just missing something but I figured this was the same type of deal as isle or paradise where you apply it then night before and let it develop eventually I realize no you add it each morning and its a one day wear type of thing It definitely gives a nice glow and really evens out my skin tone I wear concealer on top and everything looks put together which is nice It also hasnt broken me out at all which I love Just make sure you use lotion nothing fancy Cerave from Walmart works great and mix and rub in well Give it a second to settle because initially it looks a little orange but after a few seconds it evens itself out great\\nread more I like these a lot because they add a subtle bronzed and highlighted look without looking or feeling like you have makeup on I usually put this on if Im not wearing any other makeup for the day except for a little concealer on acne Really lightweight and easy you just have to make sure you rub it in all the way so you dont have brown streaks on your face Wanted to love thisunfortunately the next day after using I had a small pimple after day two of wearing my entire face is broken out My skin was perfectly clear this was the only new item added into my routine and now Im broken out on my forehead all over and my chin huge painful pimples on my chin and small pimples throughout my forehead Its unfortunate because it is a beautiful product and does exactly as it says gives a bronze glow\\nread more I bought this during one of the sales and very glad that I did Ive been trying to use cleaner products and this seemed like a great thing to add to my skincare lineup Its perfect for making your mineral sunscreen more like a tinted sunscreen and helping to hide that white cast you might get otherwise I think it makes my skin look a little glowy as well since it has a bit of a shimmer not glitter Not sure how to tell if the antipollution bit is working but Ive seen no negative effects so Im gonna say its doing its job\\nread more i am usually a huge DE fan but I have to say this product is just OK i was looking for a little more coverage and do not feel like it blends as well as i would have hoped Its fabulous Mix it with the Drunk Elephant Marula Face oil and its a flawless finish Received a 7 day sample and it while it felt nice on my skin it caused me to break out I do have sensitive skin but havent broke out like this in years Cant really say its good or bad It hasnt done anything fabulous to my face but neither has it worsened my condition Good thing is that it is very easy to use and wont cause a mess I would like to carry it around with me especially during travelling But again I havent seen a significant improvement in my skin Ive been using this product for almost two years now And while I do think its anti aging claims are legitimate I wish it wasnt so expensive  I like the product dispenser that comes with it it puts out just the right amount needed for your faceneck The product itself is pretty watery but once applied it becomes tacky and gradually sinks into your skin I found that this product also helps with keeping my skin moisturized in addition to my moisturizer and it goes great under makeup as well\\nread more Not a fan Didnt do anything for my skin definitely used better products like caudelie serum A sephora rep suggested I use this for my uneven skin tone I bought a bottle and used this product daily and didnt notice a change in my skin at all Its pricey so I was hoping so see some difference in my skin but unfortunately didnt This serum is a milky material Very interesting It feels very high end I enjoyed my sample of this serum and it reminded me of why I used Lancome products for so many years in the past I might even try a fullsized product again in the future It works very well Just as Lancôme advertises it helps you look youthful and bright Would recommend especially for any older ladies out there This product gave my pimples The texture is lovely However it doesnt work for me I had heard so many good things about this serum and was super excited to try it out but I did not have those results I have dry and dehydrated skin to begin with My skin become so dry after using this once I stopped using this my skin became 10x better if you have dry skin I would first try a sample of this before getting the full size These are my lazy day pads I mostly shower at night so I use these pads in the morning to get my daily skincare routine started So far so good Face can be a little sticky after use My advice to anyone is to have realistic expectations and to make sure glycolic acid doesnt make you break out I really like these They really brighten and soften my skin I keep seeing a trend with the negative reviews where most people seeing insignificant results all have acne as a concern I feel like acne scarring will be helped with products like this but to a certain degree I happen to not suffer from acne and just have average texture so for me these work great My skin looks brighter feels softer and I think these are a great replacement for my Good Genes that I cant in good conscious buy anymore\\nread more I did not notice an actual difference in my skin If you like these kinds of pads I would recommend the M61 PowerPeel pads They are so much better These are pretty nice But do not follow the package recommendation to use it once or twice a day Against my better judgement I tried this and got some hyperpigmentation for a few days But overall does a great job These pads are great for gentle exfoliating of the skin The smell is not too strong and doesnt stay on the skin Leaves the skin feeling smooth and silky and absorbs fairly quickly The pads are sturdy and dont tear easily which is good And after you take the pad out and exfoliate once you can wait until the skin is dry and exfoliate again as the pad doesnt dry very quickly so you could get 23 good exfoliations of the face from one pad in one go I am still iffy about the price point but its a toner and exfoliator in one so Im happy about that Good for summer and winter times and any skin type\\nread more Gentle and didnt irritate my face but I honestly didnt really see a difference in my skin I prefer to use slightly stronger weekly exfoliating products Ive been using these radiance pads for about a month now  I see no different in the texture of my skin This has been such a disappointment  the first time a First aid beauty has been ineffective Dont waste your money on this useless product Did nothing to my face and actually gave me more texture on my skin I did not want to waste the money so some people recommended using it under armpits and other areas These did not do anything for me Plus have no scent Ive used almost all the pads and each time feel like Im simply wiping my face with water A definite not get again This serum made me breakout consistently I also found that you needed to use at least two pumps to get full face coverage A little does not do a long way I have used many serums and this one is NOT worth the price point and I usually love Clarins products This serum however was very disappointing smells amazing I do not see any radiance but there is even skin tone No big impact Did not absorb perfectly Relative oil on skin It is a normal product not as recommended as most advertising says Noticed a slight improvement in skin radiance and texture  Effects were not long lasting did not help with skin tone lines or wrinkles This just didnt work for me I used almost the whole bottle because I just kept telling myself it just needs one more week I would use as part of my skincare routine every time I washed my face so 23 times a day The only difference i noticed was that my skin was more moisturized My skin texture was the same and my skin wasnt evened out I saw better results with my face oils Three stars for making my skin feel super moisturized\\nread more Its just OK Size I bought the larger size and Ive had it for a little over a year if you look on the bottom its only good for 18 months and Ive still got 13 to go I use it 2x a day so unless your taking a bath in it the small size would do just fine Quality It feels luxurious It does have a light scent nothing too strong and it glides on which I love What I dont love is that it feels like its just sitting on my skin and not really absorbing and at this price point  I got the big one  I expected a bit more from it Results Expectation Smoother more radiant skin I wanted my skin to look refreshed and glowing I take my skin care a bit more serious now that Im in my 30s What I got my skin felt soft No glow no radiance Ive continued to use it because I spent so much on it but that the only reason Ive stuck with it Would not purchase again\\nread more I find this serum is too rich for my skin personally I wouldnt repurchase based on my own skin type Smells good and I hope its better to use in winter The product was too high in fragrance for my liking so I returned it but I will admit that it didnt seem to irritate my overly sensitive skin Ive never used a lotion like this before Its completely watery Very interesting The smell is unique as well I like it I used this as a toner and it worked well Not a fan of The smell but not a big deal Doesnt work at all Been using this for serval months and my usual red cheeks are still just as red every day Doesnt moisturize or do anything good Would not recommend and will not buy again I have been struggling with acne rosacea since April 2019 After a huge flare up in December nothing seemed to work I got this yesterday and applied my bumps went down this morning when I looked in the mirror I gave 4 stars because I havent used it very long yet but fingers crossed this is it I received this as a sample in Sephora play Its the weirdest thing ever Feels like water on my face In fact when I first opened it since it has the word lotion on the bottle I wasnt expecting liquid and spilled a large amount I notice no difference using it versus not using it This is a strange product I apply it with a cotton ball The texture is like a runny lotion It feels like Im putting on toner It doesnt do a great job of moisturizing my dry skin but it doesnt dry it out either I hate the scent Even though it has mushrooms in it I dont want to smell it Day 2 After using this and the goodnight serum my face was covered in textured red bumps and my face was sensitive to the touch Its going to take weeks to get my skin back under control I cant recommend something so reactive and harsh Everything seemed fine on day 1 but the 2nd day my skin had transformed into rough sand paper I wanted to love this but I had to return it I used the goodnight glow and the serum together and the first couple weeks I saw no different what so ever then I started to break out and even get red bumpsbreakouts on my face It was not getting better even with exfoliating It was not for me and I think the retinol alternative is the issue as I have retinol sensitivities and was really hoping this alternative would be better Still searching for my holy grail\\nread more I love this brand however i knew something was off when i started to use this serum during the day I noticed my face got extremely dry and i was using this daily I also noticed my foundation would separate when i used this serum Although its safe to use during the day i personally think its preferable to use at night I love this brand and didnt want to take off a star I recently received several samples with other orders and I cant speak to the anti aging effects as I havent used it very long but I will tell you that if you put this on and then a moisturizer with a matte finish such as Youth to the People Spinich Kale Hyaluronic Acid moisturizer you end up with the that ever elusive dewy glow Then just apply some Glossier Cloud Paint do your brows and maybe some setting powder and its made my 30 year old not at all perfect skin look GLOWING AND BEAUTIFUL Love this stuff\\nread more Ive been using this product for 2 months and I have seen zero results I have very sensitive dry skin with rosacea and hyperpigmentation and cannot tolerate retinoids I was hoping this would be an option for me but it seems to be completely inert It does nothing I guess the only positive would be that it feels like nothing too  zero skin reactivity In my first trimester and looking for a product to replace my retinoids Product doesnt make me break out and goes on smoothly but still waiting to see if it works as well as retinoids  I havent noticed a change and its been 2 weeks Received the 7day sample challenge that included the night cream This seemed to upset my skin have used it five times and my face is very itchy Theres also a slight fragrance to it that I wish was more subtle I use this on days when I plan to run around doing chores and errands I get compliments from strangers that I am glowing I noticed that effect is not as strong several days in a row I have oily skin so this serum under my makeup is too much  too moisturizing So I basically use this with a heavy eye cream on days I cant be bothered with foundation No breakouts very moisturizing I would definitely recommend\\nread more This is the second time I have purchased this item I havent noticed a huge change but after I ran out I really like this serum I dont do well with Retinol dries me out but I like this alternative I wish the ingredients were cleaner why have artificial coloring but Im happy with it for now Tried it 3 years ago Barely noticed an improvement everytime I hit day 27 but if I miss ONE day I lose ALL progress and my face went back to day 1 like Ive never used it Not for me I have been using the genefique serum and loving it but wanted to bump up the treatment and try something new The Lancome rep said this would address more of my concerns I tried a sample on my hand and immediately was skeptical because I love the texture of the genefique serum so smooth soothing and as absorbed into my skin This one  not so much It had a lotion feel to it and not so moisturizing However I bought it to give it a try I got the gift set with am and pm lotions and some strange silicone eye treatment that looked like a pore filling primer Anyway I had to return it all It was so horribly fragrant It got in my mouth and tasted awful Didnt feel nice on my skin either I wanted to love it but couldnt get past the fragrance and it felt drying Exchanged for my Genefique Serum I love\\nread more I wish I could comment on how effective this product is but alas I cannot as I had to wash it off after 10 minutes due to the overwhelming fragrance which gave me a headache Such a shame as there really is no need to put so much fragrance in a skin care product I ordered this serum and was so excited to try it Unfortunately the smell of the product was too much for me and I had to wash it off I thought the odor would disappear after a couple of minutes but that was not the case I suffer with dry skin and rosacea I got this product after a co worker recommended I can tell you I can use a little less concealer and my skin is less dry but after a week using twice daily I needed to add another moisturizer this wasnt the miracle in the jar I was hoping for but is the only product I have tried that has made a difference Enough of a difference in fact Ill be trying other products in this line Ive included before and after 1 month using this product twice daily\\nread more Used this for months and saw absolutely no results Bought it twice thinking it would take a while to see results but this even doesnt even reduce the appearance of my pores at all It feels very nice and hydrating on the skin but thats what I want in a moisturizer not a serum It feels nice which is why I gave it 2 starts but the serum didnt deliver results Im aware that it wouldnt make my pores disappear overnight but I didnt even see a slight difference in the appearance of them\\nread more heres my deal Im 34 with LONG history of cystic acne my skin is oily t zone central american skin with hereditary HUGE pores been on antibiotics accutane and now on spironolactone my skin is clear for the most part except for monthly pop ups I started using this serum last year when I was on NO acne meds Then it made me break out I stopped using it  my skin cleared only a little and then I resumed using it Then I broke out again and I stopped using it but my break outs didnt stop I was put on spironolactone and now that Im clear I have resumed using it It does work but maybe not for hormonal cystic acne ppl like me This silky non oily serum is quickly absorbed into your skin you wake up with soft plump skin and over time your acne scars and pores s apppear softer and faded Your look and texture of skin seem more filtered I recommend it only if you have your acne under control Good luck\\nread more Used the entire bottle and kept waiting for results I used this over my Genifique serum Not sure that it made any difference to my skin I definitely didnt see any reduction in pore size or any change in texture Will not repurchase I always concerned about my pores and I like to try the product that can help with minimizing pores I saw some good reviews and end up purchasing this product and used the whole bottle but I didnt see any difference on my skin Let me just say Im a skincare addict And I do love lancome And yes this product is incredible at delivering AT FIRST I saw my pores and my dark spots literally disappeare within a week of use My face looked Photoshoped without makeup I couldnt believe it Naturally I ran and bought the huge bottle of that miracle But then the effect was getting less and less noticeable with time and I was starting to worry When I finished the bottle it took me ten days to order and receive the new one By that time all my dark spots were back It was so weird and frustrating Ok it made sense that pores wouldnt stay tiny forever but how does an old pimple disappear and then come back HOW With more use I realized this was doing nothing to address any skin concerns It just somehow manages to mask the problem Good old peels moisture exfoliation retinol acids etc really help but this quick fix is useless in the long run Ive kept it and I use it for a few days when I know a special occasion is coming up almost as part of my makeup But no I certainly dont rely on it to help my skin\\nread more I dont have a ton of fine lines and wrinkles but being 42 Ive definitely noticed and increase in lines around my mouth and crows feet This product works really well on softening these lines it really does make a big difference I havent had any problems with it clogging my pores like some reviewers have The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is because the product tends to separate very quicklyeasily and you have to shake it really well to be able to use it After a certain point shaking wont even help and you have to get a new one before youve used it all up Because if this I only purchase small bottles and get as many samples as I can though this still happens with even the small sample bottles Also when I first started using it I did buy several big bottles and the pump broke on all of them So there are certainly some problems with this product but when I am able to use it I really do love how effective it is on my fine lines and wrinkles\\nread more Put this on and my skin immediately started burning and turned bright red I wouldnt call my skin sensitive as I use the dr Dennis gross extra strength peel pads regularly and never have had issues with vitamin c before It goes on very smooth and makes my skin silky however today is day 5 of using it and I have started to break out I typically do not break out Also my skin becomes very very oily by the time the evening hits I do not recommend this product I initially liked this product when I got a sample and the first few weeks into this bottle but I couldnt help notice the burningirritation lasting longer as the winter months approached I have sensitive skin and I think this is ultimately just too much for it I react much better to Truth Serum Is it supposed to feel like hot glass spreading over your face while gently applying this product I wish I had returned this product Dimethicone 3 types of it  cyclohexasiloxane are what make this smooth out your skin Aka youre clogging your pores with silicone and thats why a lot of reviews you see mention breakouts or blackheads While I use other kiehls products this one is terrible I wont be using it again Got two sample packets of this with an order I love this brand but not so much this product Im 55 with comboily skin for reference This is just too heavy and doesnt have enough slip to it when blending it across the skin I much prefer a gelcream consistency that my skin seems to drink up easily Im also not a fan of the strange odor my skin exudes the next day after using any skincare products with Vit C in them I can pick it out after using them even if its not prominently labeled Id rather just keep taking oral Vit C tablets The topical ones also seem to leave me with a yelloworange tint to my skin I personally have yet to find one that brightens Id say if you have super dry skin and like a heavy feeling product you might like this\\nread more This product is useless Didnt notice any results whatsoever Its like putting a regular hand moisturizer on your face Not sure why I thought this would be effective Have used nearly the entire bottle and have noticed no change whatsoever First time I had to return something at Sephora  I really wanted to liked this product but unfortunately gave me breakouts like Ive read on so many reviews before I bought it I didnt want to listen cause you know every skin reacts different to every skin product but yeah it was bad Sorry Kiehls This was one of the first Vitamin C serums Id ever used and thought it was better than anything else Id used Now there are so many that are significantly better than this one I do NOT have sensitive skin at all but find this to irritate my skin and has a tingling sensation The cream is also incredibly thick and difficult to spread and sort of has a bit of a slight grittiness It also has a strong smell Im 32 so I use skincare as prevention and not wrinkle reducing at this point so I cant speak to how effective it is at that It was too late to return so I use it as a hand cream and neck cream and it does leave my skin feeling super soft the next day I just dont find this enjoyable to use as a face cream\\nread more I very rarely give bad reviews Sadly this was disappointing due to the complete lack of thought in the packaging At first I fell in love A creamy hydrating serum Then I got to approximate 14 of the bottles left The pump is not long enough As well is thick enough for this rich creamy serum to pump onto my hand I had to resort to tipping the entire bottle upside down To hope the enough would go to the top I ended up injuring myself As the pump was completely useless Desperately trying to get at least an entire weeks worth of product left\\nread more Giving this 4 stars because of the packaging The serum is excellent and you start to glow after the application But the bottle pump it comes in leaves a lot of product inside which is troublesome to bring out Its only 30ml and a lot gets stuck at the bottom Requesting Biossance to change the packaging I dont know if this does anything for fine lines and wrinkles But my complexion looks good and it feels moisturizing as part of my skincare routine It was my gateway drug into Biossance so Im thankful for that This is a very nice alternative retinol serum For those who are new to retinol or retinol like products or have very sensitive skin this is a good alternative Especially in Canada where Luna is no longer available its a kind of alternative on the less intense side Its a great starter or gentle alternative Unfortunately it is way too gentle for me I did notice some changes in skin softness but no real changes in lines or pores And the changes in softness took months to actualize I do like having a backup gentle retinol to use on days when a more concentrated one is too much for my skin and this is a good option\\nread more I have tried the herbivore bakuchiol serum and like this better It is a cream not sticky and does not pill I only have a sample but it does not irritate my skin and I never broke out from it I cannot speak to the dryness that some have stated but I put oil on over it moisturizer then biossance rose and vit c oil over that so I typically dont have dryness anyway Im not certain of the overall effect on fine lines but my skin texture is a bit better and no break outs due to product\\nread more I have been using this for 3 months and see absolutely no improvements to my skin Its hydrating but thats about it  I absolutely love this serum  I dont even need to follow up with a moisturizer because my skin is so soft right after using The only problem is that the pump sucks Other than that the product is fabulous I would give this 5 stars but its just so expensive And small bottle I wish a larger size was available Doesnt make me break out and absorbs quickly Ive been using this product for almost a year now Ive not noticed a difference in dark spots or large pores Its hard to tell if my fine lines fading are from this serum or my moisturizer It doesnt irritate my sensitive skin so theres that but its just not worth the money to me Also the bottle is horrible Sometimes the pump works sometimes it doesnt And its nearly impossible to get the last bits out of the bottle I have to leave it upside down for a day then whack it against my palm to get the rest out The glass bottle looks pretty but is impractical Im currently looking for a cheaper dupe\\nread more I love this serum and have really enjoyed including it in my routine Its very moisturizing and I actually feel like it has improved my skin I also love the scent The only reason I am deducting a star is for the pump on the bottle It stopped dispensing early on after I purchased so I have to unscrew the top to get it out I tweeted at the company and they said that they have heard this feedback before For someone who is looking for a gentle alternative to retinol this is a really really great choice\\nread more I love this product but the packaging is truly awful The pump is not able to reach the product once you are about half way through the bottle Im on my third bottle and this has happened every time I have to dig cotton swabs around in the bottle to try to use all the product and there is always way more product than I would like left in the bottle when I finally give up and buy a new one Other than the packaging I think this is a great retinol alternative No irritation and you can use in conjunction with other products you cant use with real retinols\\nread more I received a sample size with one of my purchases and I went ahead and bought the full size I made the sample size last me about 2 months and started seeing results in a month or so Im in love with this product Its helped my fungal acne on my forehead and cheeks quite a lot Looking forward to trying some of their other products I took one star off because of the hefty price tag I can even afford to buy another product of theirs because its all so expensive\\nread more Awful awful Every time I would try it again because maybe this time it would work smh breaks my skin out on tiny white heads all over Ill start with the good Smells good and actually makes my face feel softer Now the not so good I bought this because I developed hormonal acne all around my jaw and cheeks that I ended up taking Accutane for Before the Accutane I tried this and it did nothing for my acne Thats it it just wasnt effective for me In the beginning I saw improvements I broke out after so Im not sure I have super sensitive skin I ended up returning it i think its working its not heavy I like the smell It leaves my skin feeling very hydrated for a long time I have been using it for 1 week and I am already seeing dark spots go away 23F with mostly clear skin I had developed a bunch of acne after experimenting with shaving my face I bought this product because it was a best seller and I saw so many great reviews However I found out a couple of months ago that Sunday Riley used to pay people to post reviews on Sephora After using this product consistently for 4 months I believe that these reviews are still fake My acne did not clear up AT ALL in that time frame I decided to use a different product last week and my skin looks 100x better As of today the OTHER product gave me my clear skin back This product is just a waste of money It doesnt do anything\\nread more Lovvvve this stuff I have dryacne prone skin and this leave my skin treated for acne without over dying it Most times dry skin can leave you breaking out more due to dehydration but this product eliminates that problem  Ive used it for about 2 weeks at this point and its WORKING My acne  blemish prone skin has been suffering for over a year and I havent been able to get it under control Id go through a string of products and wake up the next morning with congested skin and blackwhite heads It was NEVER ENDING This oil does the job and cleared up my complexion within the first week of using it Definitely a must buy The only downfall is the smell Kinda smells like pencil shavings from middle school when you open the pencil sharpener\\nread more I really wanted to like this The concept is great but it caused massive cystic blemishes I tried it twice with over a month in between to be sure and this was the cause It also does not dry completely nongreasy but that wasnt a deal breaker The breakout season were I did not see difference in my skin at all This product made my skin very dry Have not bought But on an ingredient stand point Alcohol Denat is EXTREMELY DRYING and should not be in a serum meant to be used all over face please try to use alcohol free serums I raved about this product for the first year because it DOES remove dark spots with consistent use but I had to stop using for about 4 months as I was using prescription trentinoin and I didnt want to overload I started using it again this week and immediately woke up with small pimples around my mouth  it was deja vu I always used to get these before but never seemed to connect the dots Ask for a sample before committing to full size make sure this product is for you\\nread more Only bought this hoping it would help with my malasma above my lip sadly it did not Not at all Not even a little bit Okay firstly Im incredibly alarmed at how many people use this during the day and dont use sunscreen PLEASE USE SUNSCREEN Used for two weeks at bed time It broke me out with small pimples It did lighten my dark spots but I wont trade that for pimples Ive been using this product at night daily for more than 3 months now and I dont see any results my darks spots have not faded at all I am using this product from about 4 weeks now I used to have very faint spots on my face before using this product but now my spots have became darker and more visible When I went to Saphora store I did not have much of of an idea what will work best on my skin for these spots but when I talked to one of the beauty expert their she suggested me Murad even though I was more interested in Estée Lauders advance night repair serum but I still trusted her more and she also told me how to use it and how important it is to use sunscreen with product to get the best results I am doing exactly what she told me to do and still am seeing Zero results am not saying it gave me any side effect BUT my spots have definitely became more darker now Will NOT recommend to anyone TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY on this super expensive product\\nread more Did not find any difference to my skin pigmentation So Ive been using this everyday for about two weeks now and I dont really see what the product offers I feel like it just makes my pores enlarged with each use despite the Pore Minimizing Serum in its name I dont think I would go for this product again though the other Caudalie products were a hit with me I love this serum I got it specifically because I have huge pores on my tzone and Im gonna be totally honest it doesnt do much for my pores However it did smooth out my uneven skin and make it look a LOT better All in all very happy with this and how it feels and how it makes me look but wish it had done more for pores This products didnt do anything except smell you strong I have acne prone skin and this didnt help at all I would have to go in with another treatment to get rid of acne I used to use this on occasion but I now use it most nights as part of a multi step routine that miraculously cleared up my hormonal acne and most dark spots in a week I do 12 weekly peel days using Lancer polish Korres pomegranate AHA mask then Kate Somerville liquid exfolikate 2x You can then apply any ceramide cream and the dead skin rolls right off I end it with Origins planscription mega mushroom liquid lotion this Serum and the belif aqua bomb sleeping mask I can use other skincare on non peel days and it doesnt seem to affect the effectiveness of this routine\\nread more No difference in skin Used alongside the essence Wasnt worth it for me I will continue to use until dinner with it Doesnt work for me used it almost 3 months but nothing happen my scar get worst Not a miracle worker but does minimize pores with continued use Need to pair with moisturizer if you have dry skin I gave this a try for a year I saw no changes When the serum dried if there was a bit too much used if would dry white I received this product as free trial through a promo code The product badly irritated my sensitive skin I do not recommend it others with a sensitive skin type I had high expectation of this product After using the entire bottle I am quite disappointed First of all it is used up so quickly I only uses it once a day and 30ml lasts for about a month Second I dont feel any effect other than the texture and smell is nice For the most part it is moisturizing But for 115 I have so many other options Third the design of the bottle makes a lot of waste of the product and your money The tube is too short to absorb the last 3ml on the bottom Plus there is left over inside the tube and around the neck of the bottle even 110 of the product is 10 bucks I am curious how other people deal with\\nread more Made me nicely hydrated and I love the smell After trying for 10 days I saw no noticable difference that my usual moisturizer half the price of this couldnt do Was on the fence about purchasing this but luckily I received a 10 pack sample with my latest Sephora order Normally I use Estée Lauders serum which is soooo much better This just sits on my face does not sink in and its sticky Blech Will give the rest of my samples to my friends Made me breakout redness and I have bumps all over my face Some people have great results but if you are like me stay away soon is you see something out of the ordinary I even have to stop my retinoid routine until I bring my face back to normal Received a 10 pack sample with my last Sephora order Used it once and it made my entire face red itchy and dry Im so glad it was free because it made dumping it in the garbage so much easier If I could give this item 5 stars I definitely would I had purchased the gift set that had a small tube of this and at first I thought I really liked it but then a few days after I started seeing chicken skin like bumps everywhere I put this on my face I was excited to try this because of the idea of algenist using algae for beauty purposes However sadly this really flopped for me I have super sensitive skin and items that arent very clean with their ingredients always break me out If you have sensitive skin and want to try this out just do yourself a favor Dont\\nread more Dint notice a difference and the pump broke for the price I expected better quality not worth it This did make a noticeable difference in my skin in just three days however I have to give it one star because of the fragrance I am sensitive to fragrance this sticks with me all day and seems to attach itself to clothing as well The fragrance so close to my eyes makes them watery and irritated I had to stop using this product I am a fan of Algenist products just not this one This collagen might be great and work wonderfully if youre stupidrich and dont mind having to spend 115 about every 3 weeks Thats how long the tube lasts Seriously Im not convinced it really did anything anyway I received this product as a 100 points reward It is very amazing and hydrating for my dry skin However I in NO WAY WHATSOEVER can justify spending 115 on a single product I would DEFINITELY purchase a fullsize version of this if I could afford it I got a sample and it made me break out within a couple days There was absolutely nothing in the bottle I dont have a Sephora close by so I order online It was packaged fine No breakage or anything I was so disappointed Its not a cheap item that I wouldnt feel bummed when the bottle was practically empty  this bottle is truly a bizarre packaging choice  unable to get any product out at all I have oily skin and did not feel that this helped with keeping my oil in check I watched a couple reviews on this claiming that it helped reduce shine but it did not This is probably the best primer Ive used so far and Ive used quite a few It does help makeup last longer and it does blur the look of large pores I took one star off because it is expensive  I did feel it was worth it and I will buy again While I am loving the product I did purchase the mini size to assure I like the results before buying the very pricey full sized bottle Theres not enough product in the bottle for the applicator to suck up So Ive just had to rub it all over my face instead of the drops My makeup looks nice tho It did blur and minimize my fine lines not as well as some other products out there for much cheaper than thisI found I couldnt wear makeup over it was an awful primer But for my non makeup days it works well Not for dry skins After application my skin felt super dry and crusty I always wear sunscreen and my face ended up having white spots sometimes crust Its just a no no This is my first Farsali product and i honestly love it Makes my skin feel amazing and soft Blurs fine lines and pores so well This did not do much for me at all and I really didnt like the consistency It was hard to spread across my skin and I didnt notice any blurring effect Really not a fan of this product It is incredibly hard to dispense due to the product being too thick for the dropper so you just have to shake it out annoying and sometimes wasteful when you get too much I also dont feel like it provides any blurring effect at all Returned I wasnt a big fan of this Mostly because it isnt oil free and serum tend to break me out Did not experience any blurring or perfecting effect Not worth the expensive price tag Great packaging love the bottle and dropper As for the actual product NOT WORTH THE MONEY Can go and get a primer from the drug store that does the exact same thing just a lot less fancy I have no real problem with this Tip of advise if you dont know how to use this Apply this over your moisturizer if not wearing makeup because this product can be very drying if applied to bare skin Which is why it works for me due to my oily skin If using makeup apply over a hydrating primer and blend it out before applying foundation The only issues I had were the dropper getting clogged  making my foundation look bulkycakeydry However if you want a matte face after moisturizer this is great\\nread more I opened this morning to use and the bottle is completely clean and empty There was literally none in the bottle It wasnt even half full But the product was awesome This does not blur or do anything Very disappointed with my purchase  Ok this product does not actually peel your skin What you are seeing when you rub it is the product itself pilling That part is nothing more than a gimmick That being said if you adjust your expectations and view this as a chemical exfoliant that will take time to improve your skin its not bad I have used better products for the price though Ive tried many facial peels and this was just not it Your the the skin is not peeling  its the product pilling  It also left my face with a film trying to seem as it had made my skin smoother I recommend first aid beautys peels This does work but my skin is still left feeling more textured with the end result than it is using my favorite  ExfoliKate This however doesnt have any physical exfoliants And when my skin is feeling particularly sensitive thats a nice bonus Only been using it once but it seems to be working peeling my dead cells Going to keep using and hopefully see results Product lid says do not shake I dont know if Im just slow but the instructions werent clear so I had to look up a video Let it all settle and dip a qtip into the pink gunk at the bottom I didnt see quick results with this product on a big ol zit I had Worked on smaller ones I see no difference while using this product Waste of money I bought this hoping it would work like everyone said however it was pretty bad It doesnt help any of my acne Instead it seemed to make it worse When I went to wash it off in the morning I felt like there was still a lot on my face no matter what I did It seemed to do more harm than good I am prone to cystic acne and have struggle with acne only since turning 30 I am now 36 Nothing over the counter helps when my whole face is flaring up only prescriptions HOWEVER this product keeps my acne in check afterwards It is one of the only spot treatments that actually works for me It even works on small cysts albeit slowly It can be a little harsh with other strong products so I try to avoid putting anything else near pimples I am treating with this product except light moisturizers which I apply under this treatment\\nread more Personally for me it didnt do much with getting rid of my acne However I do feel like for the areas in which I applied the treatment were less susceptible to new acne forming but still did nonetheless It did a subpar job I tried for over a month then tried Murad This stuff SMELLS like straight alcohol when you apply it Once you get over that smell it smells like sulfur You might as well just slap 70 isopropyl alcohol because its the same straight smell Although this did help reduce the acne its not a miraculous treatment It takes AT LEAST two days for this stuff to target and treat the acne its not over night You wont visibly see results until days later Youre better off using tea tree oil because its naturally derived and has better anti bacterial benefits Although tea tree oil stings and is strong sometimes this EradiKate treatment is just as painful if not worse It stings just as bad and its just not as effective as people are making it out to be\\nread more Its the better version of the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion but it irritates my skin a little bit If you have sensitive skin I would not recommend this product For me when I put it on a newly formed pimple it pretty much goes away but if I put it on a pimple that I have had for a day or two it takes much longer for it to go away Super similar to the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion  almost exactly same ingredient list but twice the price I put this on after I clean my face and leave it on overnight Its a drying lotion so Im a little dumbfounded that people are surprised it dried their face out  thats the point of the product Overall I would recommend but note that again its twice the price of the MB drying lotion for the same thing I read the amazing reviews and had high hopes It did not work for my cystic acne it severely dried skin and my blemish did not reduce in size or heal faster Its pretty darn slow I wish it was some what faster as I dont like applying a drying spot treatment to be applied every single day till the bump is no more to be felt or seen It didnt irritate my skin though considering my very sensitive combo dry skin I was recommended this as a better Mario Badescu spot treatment I cant say that it is better nor worse And I cant say it doesnt work It dries out pimples if youre consistent with applying BUT this product comes off during my sleep when I need it to be doing its job Im sticking to pimple patches they never come off and the pimple is like guaranteed to be gone in the morning with the stickers esp whiteheads\\nread more Works like a gem but has a smell I honestly do think this product works I have really sensitive skin and live in a dry area and this works well even with all the other products I use for my face BUT The smell is pretty unbearable for me Because it uses sulphur I feel like it gets on my pillow and makes my pillow a tad stinky Works great but do think of the smell that make rub off Very sad this did not work Both my niece and I followed the directions exactly but to no avail I will stick with Peace Out brand until I can find another liquid acne treatment I gave this product a chance to work for over 30 days using every other day initially and gradually allowing my skin to adjust  but it was overly fragrant dried my skin caused minor blemishes and irritations and the product became flaky with moisturizer applied over it Loved the product Works great and it does redice lines on my forehead BUT A 033 oz bottle is only 25 dollars 3 small bottles is 1 oz  75 dollars where the big 1 oz bottle is 89 dont know why they price it like this This was an amazing serum I loved how it fills into my skin and really moisturizes as well I enjoyed the lightness from it That price though I love how clean this product is no parabens sulfates phthalates Which adds to the expense but clean beauty shouldnt cost us this much This was just okay for me I used it at night for about a month and noticed no real improvement in my skin If I used it morning and night I had small breakouts I cant justify spending almost 90 on a product that doesnt give me quicker results When I first started using this product the retinol left my skin extremely dry and flakey However after incorporating additional moisturizers and oils I was able to continue using this product and have seen significant improvements to my overall skin tone and texture I am into anti aging products now that I am almost 40 and I cant even believe that lol I do like this serum a lot especially for the lines that are starting to appear on my forehead Thank you to Bzz Agent for sending me this complimentary for review This product definitely works Only problem is my skin was a little too sensitive for it After two weeks of religiously using it morning and night my poor skin was angry I then reduced my usage to every other day and it was great again So just pay attention to your skin when using this Goes on nice but i used it every night for almost 4 weeks without an improvement Sadly i returned it I had high hopes because i love Murad products  If your skin is sensitive to retinol Id recommend the night cream alone This serum does its job but made my skin a scaly mess for about a week I wanted to love it but the amount of fragrance in this line is just too much If you dont mind fragrance in your skincare then this product wont bother you I liked the eye serum and night cream much more but I would use the serum again to prep my skin before my wedding\\nread more I have used retinol products before but I have to give it up for this Murad Youth Renewal Serum It did not irritate as long as I used it once a day instead of twice and it absolutely helped clear up uneven skin tone and has started to help with my fine lines and wrinkles Thanks to Bzz Kit for giving me the opportunity to try this This serum made my skin feel softer and the tone of my skin to be more even making me feel younger There was a decent amount in the bottle and I liked the squeeze application I will continue to use this product I tried using under foundation and I came out oily instead of glowing So now I use it on my legs and it gives me a perfect glow there unfortunately Im not going to spend 50 for a leg luminizer This primer gives a super beautiful finish to the skin a natural glow that isnt glittery like other radiant primers Ive tried My only issue is that I wish it was more moisturizing since I have dry skin The primer itself LOOKS nice but what stopped me from putting it on my face was the smell Im not kidding when I say it smells like someone dumped a BOTTLE of perfume in this product I instantly washed my hands but could still smell the horrible strong perfume scent and threw it in the trash Luckily since I only received a sample of this I could easily get rid of it But this shocked me because Ive liked a lot of Beccas products over the years I honestly dont know what they were thinking making it smell like this Im also shocked that EVERY review doesnt mention this smell thats how bad it is\\nread more I hated this primer its clings to everything i dont want to like texture or dry patches so much that little pores looked 3D also the glitter particles looked so horrible on my skin i couldnt even continue with my routine I took this product off and used my normal primer I didnt find this did anything for me really at all and it also broke me out Maybe I just didnt notice the effect I literally dont know what all the reviews are raving about And its not normal for products to irritate my skin and maybe my skin was just having a moment but it definitely affected my skin weirdly I have very dry skin and most primers dry out my skin even more and make my foundation look cakey This is a great primer for dry skin Gives you a gorgeous glow I also sometimes apply it over my cheekbones on top of foundation One thing if I apply my foundation with a brush or rub it in too much it can become flakey so use a light hand and a beauty blender to press down the foundation instead of move it around\\nread more I never wear foundation so I use this as more of a highlight than a primer I put it on all of the high points of my face and it gives a lit from within glow However it doesnt have a ton of staying power probably bc its a primer But you just want a healthy glow on no makeup makeup days then I think this is a great option Since I do not use a ton Ive had mine just under a year and its starting to separate I was recommend this product in store because I was looking for a skin perfecter and was so happy with the results that I repurchased it twice more once I ran out smells so good and does its job right I had really high hopes for the PTR Max Complexion Correction Pads however I am really disappointed I have been suffering from adult hormonal acne for 3 years I am 33 I have tried EVERYTHING including multiple visits to the dermatologists office I just cant kick the acne and it sucks I was so excited about this product based on the amazing reviews but it broke me out worse I didnt think my skin was overly sensitive but apparently it is based on what Ive read from others who broke out from this to Now I am left with worse acne than before I used this product for 2 weeks before giving up I threw away the box and cant return So disappointed\\nread more I should preface with stating that my skin is rather sensitive I typically stray away from harsher products since Ive had rough experiences in the past with products that contain heavy amounts of exfoliating agents However the reviews made it hard for me to pass up trying this one so I gave it a shot I had been suffering from a minor breakout along my upper lip region so I bought these to try and correct the breakout while improving the rest of my face Within two days I had giant cystic zits form on both cheeks roughly 34 on both cheeks three along my chin and three along my forehead Plus two more emerged along my upper lip Its been nearly a month now and Im still trying to combat the breakout that emerged after using these While ive considered that my skin was purging it shouldnt have been that extreme I had really high hopes and I hope it works for you Unfortunately it didnt work for me\\nread more Hey I have been using the chemical acne peel pads with the face wash Meh Got the same results from the 10 dollar neutrogena pads For almost 50 bucks i would no rebuy The only time that I would use these strips is to remove old gunk from my face But when it comes to removing blackheads I didnt see any results Im not sure what the big deal is with these No difference after using the entire box as directed Left a red spot despite following directions Did not suck out gunk Ive used most of this box as directed and dont notice any difference With cheap pore strips its quicker and I see the results right away I was very disappointed with these especially considering the price So much comes off onto this thing its like a miracle Only giving four starts because they dont give much for the price I just my strip up to fit small sections so I dont waste any I wanted to love this product I really did Did this product have a lightening affect on my skin Yup The type of lightening is a whole different story I have a few acne scars on my forehead I bought this product to address that It didnt really do that Instead this product lightened the complexion on my face I have a tan complexion After two weeks of use this product had the effect of skin bleaching agents Not what I expected\\nread more While I loved this product for how light it is has a mild fragrance I found it not fade any of my acne scaring or increase the radiance of my skin I have used 3 bottles of this At first I had really bad skin discoloration and this helped a lot with it However after a couple of bottles I think my skin got used it and stopped responding as well to it I stopped seeing the radiant look that it claimed to give and didnt really feel like it was doing much for the few remaining skin discoloration It was good while it lasted but I think Ill be moving onto other vitamin C serums out there\\nread more Patiently waited until the bottle was empty to write this review hoping to see changes I didnt see anything significant or noteworthy after consistent use  certainly not compared to other serums for half the price Yes there are some minor improvements typical of using a serum consistently not specifically because of this one This is a great product but the pump never seems to work There is very little product in the bottle as well which seems undreasonable considering the price Despite this it it great for treating acne scars So I tested this out in the worst of winter and maybe didnt give it a fair chance but this is the first time a serum has dried out my skin I know the product doesnt claim to hydrate but even if a serum doesnt claim that it should at least not affect the skins moisture level negatively What it does claim is to defend against environmental aggressors which according to Murad cold weather and winter heating arent Instead of smoothing out texture it made my skin dry and patchy I didnt wait to see if it was going to firm up or brighten my skin I just wanted my money back\\nread more For the first week I thought it did brighten my complexion Unfortunately after that week I started getting a pimple a day no exaggeration At one point I had at least 10 pimples on one side of my face I never had an acne problem before this Once I stopped using the product my face went back to normal I dont think it was worth the price It did not fade the brown spots has a weird smell not very pleasant and does not seem to last long I dont know maybe others had better success but I did not care for this product I love to try serums and received a few samples of Murads Retinol serum and loved it but I wanted a day serum so I tried this Unfortunately I did NOT notice a difference like the other Murad product I will not repurchase this serum and noticed zero difference Ive used this product for years it works So why the stars Not enough product for the price I think theyre giving less product out I dont like that and I think I can find another product thats cheaper works just as well and gives more product I keep buying expensive serums based on great holy trail reviews  keep getting zero resultsexcept breakouts I used this for months and it did not have an effect on my dark spots at all It is sticky and my skin feels tight after I put it on I used this with the essential C night cream from Murad as well and had no results Im not sure what is in this that makes it smell so funky but I just cannot get over it  Please do not buy this it gets sticky and smells after awhile Very oily residue and smells like I washed my face with fish oil This product used to be my favourite until they changed the ingredients A few years back the oil smelt very fresh and citrusy and the colour used to be more yellowish with the tiny gold particles However now it smells like really bad oil thats gone bad and it became a clear oil with gold particles that wouldnt stick to add a glow to your face I recently went to a Sephora and the store manager opened another new bottle for me and it still smelt like it had gone past its expiry I dont know what they changed in its formula but I wouldnt recommend it AT ALL After making the biggest mistake of applying on to my face my face started breaking out everywhere Trust me and do not buy this product Im surprised Sephora hasnt pulled it off its shelves\\nread more I got one of the small sizes of these along with a few of the others to try out  sooo glad I didnt waste my money on a full size one but I still feel my money was wasted because I ended up throwing this away after only four or five uses I really wanted to love it and really tried to at least use it up but honestly it smelled like fish oil and since it wasnt making any difference to my skin I just couldnt deal with that smell The fishy smell persisted on my skin for several hours after applying  even after makeup on top  so I had to toss this I have other face oils that work well and dont smell so I couldnt see a good reason to keep it I cant understand what amazing benefits could possibly be in this to make it worth putting up with that smell when there are other excellent oil products out there that smell neutral or even nice\\nread more Not for oily skin made my soon 100x more oily than usual and it was very sticky This product used to be my daily routine morning and night Until they decided to change or hold back on some of the ingredients I still have my travel size vs the regular size that I recently just purchased and the smell is just awful The oil seems to be thicker as well I still love the product but the smell is horrid The one thing that woke me up nicely with this product was its lovely citrus scent now it just smells like Im applying cooking oil on my face I had finally convinced my best friend to purchase this product and right she had returned for the simple fact that it doesnt have smell right Smells like the oil went bad I understand the Volcanic oil has a natural displeasing scent but for the Rose Gold Elixir this wasnt necessary Too bad\\nread more Very hard to apply Gold flakes dont actually make a difference from face oils without This oil is really good It moisturizes so well and leaves my skin so soft Has a funny smell and gets super think over time Would not buy again Its moisturizing but too oily for my liking Gold flakes are cool I loved the product initially but it eventually started to smell like fish oil Before it went bad though it was a staple piece in my skincare Was super disappointed it started to smell so bad Not sure if Ill repurchase I love the idea and whats its for but hate the smell Smells kind of fishy or seaweed like smell Wish it had another smell to it Other than that works great I really wanted to love this product but unfortunately after only a few uses it started to break out my skin The dropper seems to have gotten clogged with gold flakes etc It was still in the box but I hadnt used it in about 6 months Took it out for winter  its still full but hard to dispense Broke me out like nothing ever has my forehead became covered in a bunch of small bumps I purchased Farsali mini pack a set pf four serums One of them was the Rose Gold elixir It didnt do anything for me except make me feel like I put oil on my face which is exactly what this is an oil lol I am so glad I didnt buy this in a full size bottle Its not a cheap product and lets face it if we really need oil for our face there are plenty other cheaper options out there which would probably feel the same and do the same thing that this one is supposed to do I really didnt get what made it worth almost 50 I wouldnt buy it Other serums by farsali are good I especially like the unicorn essence and the skintune blur serums Their Liquid Glass serum is also good I just didnt find this serum in particular useful at all\\nread more Broke me out put whiteheads all over me Only good for moisturizing the lips Any vitamin C E serum or olive oil would do the same or it might smell better Its nice to use oil under your makeup however it doesnt have to be that expensive First Time Every Returning a Sephora Product Ive tried a lot of pricey skin serums and oils and Im here to tell you this stuff is either a gimmicky joke or this brand has some serious qualitycontrol breeches in their production pipeline with badbatches still lining the shelves of Sephora as of late December 2019 As a skincare aficionado I was excited to try this stuff especially because the price point seemed pretty low for a product allegedly containing a bunch of topnotch ingredients including gold Jokes on me The moment I opened the bottle I knew something was wrong It smelled like old rancid canola oil thats sat lidless in the back of your cabinet for 4 months I appreciate and use mostly fragrancefree products Im a huge fan of some of Biologique Recherches stinkybuteffective serums Consequently I think I can tell the difference between smelling odd in a rancid way versus smelling odd in simply a natural ingredient way This stuff falls decidedly in the former category Despite my smellbased instinct that something was off I made the mistake of applying a small amount to my face Unlike other highquality oils this did not seep into my skin to leave behind fresh nonoily dewy moisture It seemed to stagnate on the surface of my skin leaving behind an unbreathing oily veneer It felt so uncomfortable that I washed it off less than an hour later In hindsight this is probably why I only mildly broke out a day later as opposed to the massive breaking out that some of the other reviewers experienced Im one of those consumers who gets that the performance of personal care products can be nuanced given skintype and environmental factors so my default isnt to immediately assume Ive been scammed and leave a punitive review However this product was bad enough that I felt a moral obligation to return it in hopes that it might compel Sephora to flag any badbatch or fraudulent marketing issues\\nread more I loved this oil at first and I used to put it on my lips before applying lipstick but the oil got cloudy once I was about half way down and the consistency changed a lot Not sure what happened but I was kind of disappointed Ive been using it for a while now about once a week and the only pro I can think of is that when I use it on pimples as a spot treatment it helps slightly reduce the inflammation Otherwise I dont feel like its been doing anything positive In fact my pores look larger which is a side effect some clay masks have so Ive been told belatedly The smell too puts me off Thankfully I bought the mini size otherwise it wouldve been even more of a waste of money\\nread more Overpriced because it doesnt actually do anything to help heal blemishes or even remove blackheads The sephora brand charcoal mud mask was more effective in clearing pores did okay job of clearing pores other products can do a better job I think I wanted to love this I love other fresh products but every time I tried it broke me out I thought since I was trying different things when I originally bought this it could be something else causing the breakouts so three months later I pulled it out again and only put it on my cheeks since thats my biggest problem area Unfortunately this morning Ive woken up with three large sore bumps I know are going to take a while to go away again Frustrated because Ive been switching products trying to find the right thing for months that wont make my cheeks worse and get rid of all this scarring and now just as I was moving forward Im two steps back  trust your instincts if something doesnt work for you return it or throw it out I wish I never tried this again\\nread more I have acne prone skin and this product made me breakout even more I purchased it because it was supposed to help clear my pores but I got completely opposite result Maybe it works for other people but Ive noticed that all the products offered by fresh make me breakout Just keep that in mind if you easily get acne like me I have to start off by stating I do not have sensitive skin but for some reason this is the third fresh product Ive used and had a reaction This time is was a lot more mild than my other reactions maybe because this time it was a mask instead of their moisturizers but took the mask off and had 5 brand new very generously sized pimples I dont know why this brand doesnt work for me but yeah this is the last product Ill be trying from this brand sadly\\nread more ive been using this product for about a month now and have really been liking it I initially went in to sephora to try a squalane oil but the sephora employee recommended this instead its my first face oil and I love how soft it makes my skin feel my only issue is it occasionally doesnt hydrate my skin enough and ill have to use a face lotion in addition this could also have something to do with the dry winter so ill have to wait and see how it fares come springtime I have oily skin and was worried this would break me out but it has not at all i use it after i cleanse before bed and in the morning\\nread more I love Sunday Riley products but the Juno is just ok Too expensive with no impact on skin Im a huge Sunday Riley fan but this product didnt work for me I returned I got a teeny tiny sample and so far so good After reading up on the info I noticed theres some Vitamin C I use it at night and I use retinol I dont know if that will cause issues but is the vitamin C substantial amount or just miniscule Ive been using this product for maybe a year now and my recent purchase made me feel that this product is made differently It didnt nourish my skin like it used to so I quit using it  I was leery about this oil until I used it in the dead of winter with the heat on full blast then it was the only thing that kept my face moisturized overnight if I layered it under a moisturizer Six drops in my hand then I smeared it on my face and neck The moisturizer after kept it from sliding into my eyeballs while I slept The first couple of weeks the oil smelled like kale and black cumin oil Note Black cumin oil can smell like pencil shavings when rancid btw After a month there is now a thin white film on one side of the bottom of the bottle I hope it is not contaminated or rancid Screw that lid on tight ladies\\nread more Okay this was a hard review because this product helped my skin It makes me feel glowy I really feel like the way my skin looks and feels noticeably better since I added this oil to my regimen THE REASON FOR THE 3 star review the smell It literally smells like old grease on the stove I smell it all day long and then somebody even told me my HAIR smelled like cooking oil or grease when they hugged me Soooooo like I said its a tough one for me Great skin but smell like a deep fryer Is it worth it Im really not sure\\nread more Im very big on face oils especially since I have extremely dry skin This did nothing beneficial it left an oil fil on my dry skin and almost didnt sink in fully Not for me Im very big on face oils especially since I have extremely dry skin This did nothing beneficial it left an oil fil on my dry skin and almost didnt sink in fully Not for me I use almost every Sunday Riley product This is my least favorite It is quite oily It isnt like a light oil like CEO Glow or Luna Its very heavy Perhaps it will be better for those with dry skin I really havent noticed a huge difference with it either It is basically okay Its nothing special nothing horrible I will not be repurchasing this one Very mediocre unfortunately I assumed that an oil would be more hydrating than a lotion I used this on a regular basis for a couple weeks and sadly my skin became very dried out It hasnt happened with other facial oils or lotions so I am pretty sure this product has drying effects with regular use I did not see any visible changes in the overall brightness and dark spots after 3 months of use I am using it as a wrinklepreventing serum on my neck I dont plan to repurchase this serum Ive been using kiehls vitamin c for long and it work so well but when I found about this product I was so excited to try it since it can brighten and reduce fine lines Ive been using it pretty consistently every other day for a month and nothing happened My dark pimple mark is still there nothing changed kiehl vitamin c I was able to see result over night It can slightly lighten dark marks over night I was shocked anyways fine line didnt see any changes at all Brightening did not happen ON TOP OF EVERYTHING IT BROKE ME OUT LARGE PIMPLESBAD ON MY LEFT CHEEK AND I NEVER BREAK OUT once in a while I get one pimple I am SO returning this Will not buy any products by this brand again Dont waste your money if you want a brightening serum Get kiehl\\nread more I love using this in the morning because it does help my eyes look awake and rested I did not see a huge difference in my dark circles and fine lines I believe I am using too many of the products from this line and so when I added this my skin broke out in small red bumps Im going to use it on my neck I use their nighttime version of this and that may be enough Nopebeen using this over a month Has a weird smell sticky and doesnt absorb Theres no way you can put makeup on over this I sat n front of a fan for 15 minutes hoping it would dry and had to was it off to put my makeup Caused my face to break out and my face has never broken out No difference It Works So far this product is great on my skin After just one day my skin was already brighter felt softer and my skin tone was more even Also helped decrease size of new pimples I had on my face Ive been using it for 5 days straight and comparing day 1 to day 5 my skin looks undeniably brighter and healthier If it gets rid of all my dark marks I will definitely give it 5 stars5 Has not done my sensitive skin any favors Caused oily blemishes So hoped this would be a good replacement for Dr Brandt Retinol Serum which lately has shipped oxidized yellow product Serum absorbs quickly into the skin which I like It doesnt irritate my skin as well However I dont really notice results after finishing the entire bottle No noticeable change in skin texture pores brightening or uneven skin tone It probably works on other people but not for me Will not repurchase I purchased this product last year and it took about 89 to finish the 1 ounce bottle I am 27 acne prone combination with sensitive light skin that seems to be getting more sensitive with age I enjoyed the formula and did see results with brightening and smoothing of my forehead lines I also used the extrastrength acid peels from dr Grossbeautiful formula and I bought the big 88 box Together they work beautifully This is an investment Its either this or I cheap out and use the ordinary Granactive retinoid serum The difference of quality is obvious the ordinary works but the formula isnt as luxurious meaning it usually is more harsh and drying Also since I have combination skin I needed something that worked well in both areas of my face Ive had recent bad hormonal breakouts so I needed to switch to something heavy duty and Im on curology with a retinoid in my formula and its been tricky to keep motivated to keep with it because of how strong the formula seems to be Once I feel my acne has calmed down I will probably switch back to the duo I was using Its just easier because you dont go through that weird dry flaky phase3rd month of it and you can continue to incorporate other products without your skin freaking out retinol wise\\nread more After using this consistently over the course of 23 months I do notice that my face is marginally smoother however at 245 this does not pack the punch that I hoped it would This serum is incredibly gentle and enjoyable to use making it a luxurious self care addition to your skincare routine However if you are truly looking to fight hyperpigmentationtexture concerns or even out and brighten your skin tone I would recommend a different serum with more potent active ingredients Pitera and niacinamide are the first few ingredients listed for this product which is reassuring  I do not doubt that over years and years of consistent use your skin will very slowly and subtly transform with this serum However I personally do not have that patience or wallet capacity especially when there are significantly more potent and effective niacinamide products out there at a tiny fraction of this price\\nread more Too expensive for what it delivers Ive been using this product for months and have not noticed any brightening or even moisturizing effects Id look elsewhere before splurge on this useless product On top of not doing anything to my skin this product also irritates my skin I think my skin has gotten a lot of sensitive ever since FYI I used this serum 34 times a week after cleaning and toning this did honestly nothing which I was so disappointed about because I purchased this with my own money the two stars are for the lovely scent texture and packaging I just wish it would have done anything I was never that impressed with the original essence and this is really no different These are very over priced skincare products with very subpar payoff They smell wonderful they moisturize However so do many other products that cost a fraction of what these do Im sorry but if youre buying this for any other reason than a boujee purchase youre a fool Smells Good Feels Good but the only difference I noticed is that after use my skin is EXTRA oily for two days I have combination skin and if I put this on during my bedtime routine wash my face in the morning and apply my usual primer makeup etc I have to use 57 cleanclear oil sheets throughout the day whereas I usually would use 1 mid day Its pretty gross my makeup just melts off throughout the day for a couple days after use Gave two stars for smell feel and packaging but just cant use\\nread more If you put some of this serum on the palm of your hand and rub it into your palm it shimmers like it has teeny tiny crystals in it Imagine Edward Cullens face in Twilight when hes in the direct sunlight  putting this on your face is kind of a toned down version of that look because basically youre spreading teeny tiny light reflecting pieces of glitter on your face Im pretty sure most of the magic of this product is in the way the light reflects off these tiny specks of glitter and makes your face shineradiate So far one week in I havent seen any skin deep results where its cleared out any old sunspots or dark areas it feels like its mostly a party trick with the glitter in the serum If you have oily skin this might make your skin look a bit shinier because of the glitter in the serum I will continue to use because I think if I use it minimally it can work well as a highlighter The dropper applicator is also kind of weird because its just not the easiest thing to use and Im concerned that Im gonna be wasting a lot of product when I get to the end of it Im not sure if I will purchase this again it will depend mostly on how my dark spots look when Im done with the bottle\\nread more This year I can really see that my skin is aging as a new sun spot started forming near the corner of my eye I decided to purchase this serum since my skin have developed a lot of sun spots over the year Within 2 weeks the new sun spot is completely gone I dont see any effect on the old sun spots though I will continue buying this product Yeah so I wasnt as impressed as some of the reviewers on here I tried a sample that lasted me almost one week The serum is creamy but lightweight It goes on smoothly and a small amount of product can cover the entire face neck and décolletage I did like the way my face looked when I put on the serum but I honestly didnt think it did anything to my skin its just that it has an iridescence to it and whatever shimmery particles are in it they make the skin look like its glowing I can glow by mixing a little bit of shimmer cream or drops into my sunscreen and I dont have to spend a ridiculous amount on a serum Its a good product but Ive tried amazing ones for less 80 dollars or less This one is not amazing its just overpriced because of the brand name No thank you\\nread more Not worth the money This sat on my skin and pilled when I put my moisturizer on Too heavy and didnt leave me radiant or hydrated at all I recently finished the entire bottle and didnt really see any results at all just 240 poorer The consistency was light and had a nice scent but I wouldnt purchase again I got the free product as part of a campaign for BzzAgent I have been using it for the last 6 weeks The pros are that the dropper makes it easy to dispense the product There is no waste and an adequate amount is dispersed I have noticed that my face feels brighter and I have no new pigmentation although the old brown spots are still there I have been complimented by my friends and am always asked if I have had a brightening facial The product is easily absorbed and does not feel heavy or oily There has been no breakouts and the product is incredibly light and is absorbed without problems The fragrance is pleasing and not heavy or overwhelming I will continue to use it after I run out of my free product hoping that my old brown spots will be lighter I think this product will be good for any type of skin and is good for preventing formation of new brown and pigmented spots\\nread more Had to return it It is a clear paste with a thick silicone like consistency The problem is that it pills I waited about 10 minutes for this to get absorbed and it looked like it had So I followed by applying my moisturizer and noticed that it pills Tried it again with both my sunscreen and my foundation and the same thing happened So unfortunately had to return it Tried this product based on positive user feedback I would say its just average in that it provided no more or less hydration or skin benefits than a drugstore serum like Olay In that sense I consider this rather expensive for a small amount of product compared to drugstore brands where coupons make purchasing Olay  Aveeno or Garnier a better buy One plus about this serum is that gel absorbs fast and is easy to layer moisturizer on top I combined the serum with a drop of Revitalift hyaluronic acid for boost of moisture and softness\\nread more I love this serum It is so hydrating and leaves my skin feeling great The only issue I have is that it takes awhile to sink in This gave me little whiteheads all over my face every time I used it I dont usually have sensitive skin so I was surprised Was bummed to stop using it because it did feel very hydrating Got this on recommendation of an employee when looking for a less expensive option to the Caudalie Vinosource serum This stuff is STICKY It does not feel hydrating at all Super disappointed and will be returning ASAP This was not a good fit for me I have sensitive dry dehydrated skin that has been doing alot better lately so I thought I could try working a serum in I tried this last night and it immediately soaked in to my skin It drew out my faded melasma making it very dark and prominent It left dry patches on my cheek and strange red dots My whole face felt tight itchy and dry from this I know everyone and their mother loves this brand but its a no go for me\\nread more This and my Mandelic acid from the Ordinary in the evening when Im super tired Best combination for me I love it Did not notice anything bad or an allergic reaction Keeps my skin hydrated Nothing bad to say about it but Im not 5 stars amazed I used this for a week on top of my regular routine and it did absolutely nothing Maybe for summer if you have oily skin But definitely does nothing for skin on the dryer side in colder months My search continues I am a Tatcha fan so it bread my heart to give this product a low rating I was looking for deep hydration however this serum failed in keeping my skin hydrated I had to layer and oil and a moisturizer on top I live in the Pacific Northwest where the climate is cold and dry despite the constant rain so my skin gets dull and uneven quickly I really wanted to love this serum based on the reviews I read but sadly it just didnt work for me\\nread more I have been using this Tatcha firming serum for several years now I love it as a base for cooler dryer months for its penetrating hydration It has also tightened my skin significantly After applying it seems has if there where invisible stings that gave me a lift I use this has a base and use a cream moisturizer on top Also its a clean product and Im not allergic to anything in it so my skin doesnt get red after application The price is a little tough for the wallet though\\nread more Nothing that stands out here Does a decent enough job hydrating but interchangeable with many other serums I love this line but this product did nothing for my skin Skin does look more hydrated more plump less dull Product feels sticky when applying but after putting moisturizer skin doesnt feel as sticky I gave it a 3 star because its pretty pricey Really like this serum BUT it goes so fast I only used one pump a day and it was gone in maybe a months time For how much it costs theres so many other options that will last much longer I really wanted to love this product I own a few other things from this line so I figured this hydrating serum would be a great addition to my skincare routine for the winter time Tried this product a few times and every time I used it I noticed myself getting white heads from it I wanted to love it but my skin just repelled this Not for me Something must be wrong with me because I dont see any firming effects despite using the whole bottle However I still love this serum so so much Theres a gold very subtle shimmer almost imperceptible under makeup though it smells amazing and my face does feel and look hydrated My pores look smaller and this doesnt make my face greasy I have an oily tzone or clog my pores However I wouldnt repurchase this product because of the price tag and because I see no firming effects at all There are other serums I love that are even more hydrating Im indifferent to this product so I recommend this serum but also I certainly see no difference when not using it and I wont be sad when I finish the bottle nor will I repurchase it If you really want to try it wait for the Rouge sale If you dont mind the price tag and are dying to try this serum give it a try\\nread more For 95 I expected more I havent broken out since I was a teen and this broke me out so bad and my pores look disgusting I love all of the other Tatcha products I use So disappointed in this especially at this price point For its price it is not good enough for me I dont mind the stickiness of the serum but it is not hydrating enough for me and not forming my skin at all Love this Hydrating and I always feel It makes my face look tighter without that tight feeling I use this only in the mornings at the moment with my jade roller So relaxing Its a bit pricy so I took a star off I added this serum to finish my night time routine instead of using THE WATER CREAM as my moisturizer The consistency is slightly heavier and stickier than comparable serums It absorbs into the skin fairly quickly but does leave a residue The scent is light and pleasant and not overwhelming The packaging is nice though the bottle does seem small compared to other full sized TATCHA products I have only been using it for about two weeks now so I cant attest to any visible improvements to wrinkles or other signs of aging but my skin has broken out all over If I do not see any improvements in a months use I will be returning this product Unfortunate as all my other TATCHA products have been stellar\\nread more I always have high expectations for serums because I would think they would be concentrated with all the things our skin loves I was disapointed by this serum even though I had high hopes I just did not notice anything different after several months of use other than it was moisturizing I wanted to love this bc YTTP is one of my all time favorite brands but this wasnt it sis First off its extremely sticky and for whatever reason it broke me out terribly Ive never had this issue with any other YTTP product so I was surprised Its also EXPENSIVE so I would save your money and try something else Great moisture for sensitive skin I use this a few times a week at night helps with skin texture as well Havent found it super brightening but a nice addition to my weekly skincare I use almost the entire YTTP line and this is the only product I havent repurchased Its sad because the serum itself is great but the packaging is a huge problem The pump on the bottle is awful It either wont work at all or shoots out WAY too much product Ive tried running it under hot water to clear it out but its been like this since I started using it Its way too expensive of a product to have faulty packaging like this I switched to Herbivores oil serum which has a dropped and works amazingly if YTTP ever fixes the pump on this product Ill reconsider in the future\\nread more I had somewhat mediocre expectations for this and sadly it did just that It didnt leave my skin glowy or feeling any type of way whatsoever It sinks in very fast which should be a good thing but it really didnt feel like anything happened like it just vanished I didnt notice any difference on my skin at all Ive been using this everyday for the past month and a half I do however really like the packaging and that there is no scent also the fact that it didnt irritate or cause any break outs I just wish it did more Maybe my skin just needs more  I will continue using it until i finish it but will not repurchase\\nread more Are the ingredients right According to the one Ive purchased the first ingredients goes water vitamin c map glycerin butylene glycol vitamin b5 polysorbate 20 I mean its a totally different product if you compare to your website The ingredients listed on the website makes the product look much more potent than the ones listed on the real product what gives The acids and peptides are listed very low on the real product the peptides are from number 29 on the real ingredient list Well it definitely explains why I find this product to be less than effective the only ingredient in this with just a smear of potentness is the map magnesium ascorbyl phosphate as the second ingredient but the percentage is unclear soo also I find this very drying and tightening cant really find a reason for buying this not moisturizing and not as effective as other forms of vitamin c and the concentration is a mystery\\nread more This is a reliable multitasking serum If you dont have a regimen its an awesome entry point to proven ingredients When I first started using it going from 0 serum it definitely helped If you have a more involved skincare routine its probably not going to transform your skin  but its allinone and gets the job done for a relatively moderate price I came back to it for a second purchase when I wanted to pare down my routine Overall recommend\\nread more I went through two bottles and absolutely loved what it did for my skin The time between the first and second purchase I saw a HUGE difference in the texture of my skin On the third bottle it started to not have the same effect Im not sure if my skin got used to it or I got a bad batch Im trying something else for now but will probably try this again after I used this for 3 weeks  no change I recommend Tatcha for those that want more even  bright skin Ive had this for about 4 months I stopped using it when I saw no results after 8 weeks of use Now Im just trying to use it up so I can justify buying another serum For me its been just a high priced Hyaluronic acid serum Its hydrating but not at all brightening Coming from someone with combinationoily but sensitive and acne prone skin if that helps Basically wasted my money on this product I dont think this serum did anything to help achieve my clear and glow skin I would not recommend this product to anyone Better for plumping skin than for targeting hyperpigmentation Takes awhile to work but it does lighten scars and make your skin look more hydrated 23 months to notice significant difference Gave it one star less because of the price Its a good product I love the Hyaluronic acid that works very well in this serum The vitamin C does not work well though Ive now gone through the whole bottle and Ive notice no effects from the vitamin c I kept using it for the hyaluronic acid aspect of it but the vitamin c doesnt work at all I have used better vitamin c products than this Too watery and the pump is not efficient Squirts every where This just doesnt work Have noticed no difference in blemishes when using this I even applied it multiple times a day Still nothing Save your money So this has to be my favorite spot treatment so far Ive tried EradiKate flop I used natural tea tree oil great but I think my skin has become immune lol tried peace out acne spots another flop  I was contemplating origins but Ive heard mixed reviews Fortunately this seems to do the job You have to be consistent with it however at least 2x a day  consecutively at that You can feel the tingle when it hits your spots but it doesnt burn your skin And it def works in getting rid of them I first bought the travel size discontinued now I believe so when I ran out purchased the full size I The price for the amount wont make me repurchase however Ill find another alternative\\nread more Made me super itchy which made me touch my face more than consequently my face broke out everywhere This did nothing but harden my pimple under the skin turn my pimple dark and now I have marks left on my face I have never had a pimple last so long on my skin will not use or recommend This stuff doesnt get rid of my pimples all it does is make my face peel severely I put it on three days ago and my skin is STILL peeling This does NOTHINGGG All it does is make the area of the blemish flaky and dry It doesnt reduce swelling or puffiness or semi cures the blemish at all Do yourself a favor and buy the Mario badescu sulfur spot treatment instead that works wonders and actually feels like youre doing something to help a blemish  unlike this So disappointed While this product seems to reduce the size of my breakouts it left a strange film over my spots that was hard to remove At first I though that it was my skin peeling but really the product is just impossible to remove I found myself having to use tweezer to pull off the product the next morning because if you apply makeup over the spot treatment even after washing your face it will appear flaky dries out the pimple so much that the surrounding skin flakes off and peels was worried it would cause scarring and definitely think its too tough on skin Was so excited to try this but it was horrible for me The product kept balling up no matter how much I rubbed it in I literally would sit there for a full minute rubbing and it never stopped balling up and peeling This product also broke me out soooooo bad and I never break out I have a zit maybe once a year or two and this product gave me 5 break outs after only using it for 3 days Glad I got a mini size to try before dropping a ton of money for the full size\\nread more I love this product It does what it says for the most part and I have bought over and over but it is so expensive I cant keep it up anymore Im trying to put together a longer lasting solution in terms of months of use not while on face Love the way my skin feels is protected from UV with SPF and the makeup holding power is good I NEVER write reviews but this product IMMEDIATELY balls up on my skin upon application I got the mini version in a set Not worth it Do not buy It made my makeup slip off my face and added a grease like feel to my skin Did not like at all When this stuff says apply to clean skin that is no joke If you have anything on under it it will pill up and make little goopy balls on your face The texture is terrific but the price is a deterrent It leaves a lovely mat finish so no greasy residue Great over moisturizer and under foundation doesnt work so well under powder alone pills up Nice texture and good mattifying I used a sample of this when I was traveling as an alternative to my usual sunscreens normally I reach for Supergoop or La Roche Posay One use was enough to break me out really badly I know this product is what caused it because I had not changed anything else about my routine in months Instead of just dunking on this product and leaving it at that I want to break down why it broke me out and why this formula isnt very good First of all it is formulated with SEVEN different fragrances My skin can maybe occasionally handle a little bit of fragrance but using more fragrances in your routine does increase the chances for irritation Additionally this product contains retinyl palmitate an inactive form of vitamin A that isnt particularly safe for regular use nor is it at all necessary to include in a sunscreen Its entirely possible that the inclusion of this ingredient also contributed to my skin reacting poorly I dont like giving bad reviews but people deserve to know what is in their products and why they are potentially having a negative reaction to them There are plenty of other clear sunscreens on the market that have much cleaner formulas Supergoop comes to mind as does Coola and Volition  by the way I am not sponsored by any of these brands I recommend purchasing one of those products or one of many many others out there instead\\nread more Has an offputting smell and broke out my skin Will not repurchase It does feel like a primer when putting it on Be careful through and put on a thin thin layer If you try to put it on like sunscreen and rub it all over it balls up Its perfect for a no foundation day but if you want to put makeup on top of it just make sure you apply it gently and lightly This is my everyday go to It makes my skin feel smooth and is a completely invisible barrier It works as a primer and keeps my CC cream on My skin feels softer and my pores are continually looking smaller Dries quickly there I like it product lasts a really long time I have been using this serum for about eight months now and it has improved the redness and overall texture of my skin I usually change products every six months or so because I like to try new products on the market but I love this one so much I have decided to stay with it I notice the expression lines on my forehead are significantly decreased with use of this serum I knocked off a star because it hasnt gotten rid of all my fine lines and wrinkles But it did quite a bit to my forehead expression lines So I have nothing totally negative to say about the formula but also I dont have anything crazy positive to say It didnt really effect the look of my skin but also didnt cause it to dry out Its just meh This is after using a semi full bottle read to find out why I think Im most upset about the actual packaging The dropper malfunctioned popped out of the socket and leaked all over my bag I would say its a fluke but the dropper wont function properly when closed I still would recommend the product oddly enough but only if you dont mind shelling out the money Worth trying because I do believe it can help people Maybe its too early for me to say\\nread more This was recommended by a Sephora employee but to be honest I have been using for a month now and have not noticed any significant difference I will keep using until I finish the bottle since it was pricey but unless I see improvement I wont be purchasing again Ive been using this for six months At most it makes my skin soft but doesnt do anything that a retinol should This was my first retinol product and for 65 I expected more This product didnt work at all Its a super mild retinol if there is any at all My skin never flaked from this product I could dump it all over my face and it wouldnt irritate it one bit A retinol should be strong enough so that you can only use it sparingly This is not a great retinol if you can even call it that especially for the price I really dont understand all of the positive reviews I did not give this product a proper trial period The product was strong and stung a little more than I wanted to endure regularly Best thing Ive ever bought This has been the only thing to help with my acne It cleared up my skin after one day It is very drying I would use every other day It also helped my skin less oily I have cystic acne that is persistent It ebbs and flows and now that Ive started a new birth control I am breaking out like a hormonal teenager  I am 29 Its embarrassing Ive been using this for just under a week now I am acne prone with a very oily Tzone with combination skin I never have a problem with staying moisturized because Im so oily However this did try out my face immensely AS EXPECTED it is benzoyl peroxide I use 23 pumps twice a day following my cleansing routine then apply moisturizer It drastically evened out my skin texturewise I only feel a few bumps when I cleanse  my skin is smooth Now to get rid of scarring I cant believe how quickly this helps rid of my cystic acne I have only gotten one breakout since starting this within the last week High hopes I also love the ExfoliKate cleanser\\nread more Doesnt work at all on my face And I dont like how it feels on my face It is not deserved for 42 This product does aid in providing acne treatment for acne prone skin but in a weird way it feels drying on my face and causes my skin to produce even more oils in my tzone and entire forehead area If it didnt dry me out I would give it more stars Maybe not good for winter use either because of the drying after effect Didnt see any difference Im married to a morrocan and have pure Moroccan oil from Morocco this is processed ingredients not pure Be careful what you put on your face This product is very hydrating I have given it 4 stars due to the price I thinks its just a little too expensive for what it is I am not sure if I would buy this again even though it did do a great job or if I would look for something else Received this product and it smelled rancid like it had been either tainted or old Bought this instead from QVC where their inventory turns over quicker Pro Doesnt cause breakouts Con Texture or smell isnt appealing I have sensitiveacne prone skin I was yes something moisturizing but something that wouldnt clog my pores Decided to give this a try Ive been using this for a few days now and one thing i love about this is that i can put this on under and over makeup I like the dewy look it leaves on my face You definitely do need to use 35 drops or else it feels like you have nothing on Really feels the skin feeling hydrated and reapplying it over makeup feels rejuvenating I gave it 4 stars because the dropper i feel like is not the best Takes some time to get the product out since it pumps out bubbles first\\nread more I have oily skin and have great results with serums This product gave me dry patches Used 2 bottles and it did nothing for me but give me dry patches Such a shame I wanted to love this I agree with many other comments yeah its overpriced Theres nothing bad about using that but no effects either I only purchased it once and will not repurchase LOVE this product I have combination skin and this provides just the right amount of hydration during the warmer months Ive been wanting to try this for a while but kept going back to my regular moisturizer Finally bought it and when I received it the bottle felt empty and I had to tilt it to get the product out Sephora send me another one and again it feels like its empty The products were both done in ten days It does moisturize as it promises but I wanted to LOVE this since Im an avid aragon oil user Its the same as any other one\\nread more This mask works a little too well I accidentally left it on for twice as long as the instructions said which caused my face to become extremely dry but hey my pimples were gone I cant get over the price of this especially with all the other acne med costs like 50 a month supplements plus 50 a month wash a mask works good but isnt the only answer Id rather buy Proactiv Refining Mask from eBay Its super affordable and I use it all the time Every day even if need be Their older formula works better but the new one still is the only acne solution I have found that helps Im 30 and have battled acne my whole life Ive even changed my diet no dairy no red meats no sugar no fried foods no white rice just brown same with pasta Ect Gutted my diet I eat kale and garlicavocado peanut butter apples Things amazing for skin Even take Evening Primrose Fish Oil Vit E\\nread more So Ive used now for nearly a month I suffer from adult nodular acne not severe though I read the reviews and thought Id give it a go Honestly didnt do much at all for my breakouts but it felt cooling on and didnt overdry my skin which I appreciate The smell wasnt overpowering either The price is a little extreme co side ring the lack of benefits and I wont be purchasing again I can find a similar and cheaper alternative at the drug store\\nread more Made me break out and overly dried my skin I dont recommend Good product It will dry your skin if you use it too much However for the price I expect to see results with in a day or two The product is made with sulfur So if you can found sulfur for less buy it It took about 3 weeks for me to start seeing a difference with acne However my acne isnt clear its still there Its just doing a little better I did notice that my skin appeared to look better after a few uses After that it just start looking back to normal\\nread more I really REALLY wanted to love this mask because it has so many good reviews However I find that I break out more than usual while using this mask I have very oily sensitive acneprone skin and using this mask made me break out like crazy all over my chin unfortunately  I do notice however that its great for my nose area as my pores seem to shrink and unclog around my nose Might just have to use the rest of the product for just the nose once in a while Also important to note  I really dont think the smell is that bad It smells quite medicinalso if youre used to using a lot of prescription creams for your face this smell wont phase you\\nread more This mask will help clear up some of my blemishes but then make me break out really bad on my cheeks which I never struggled with before using this mask I would not recommend using this on the day of a big event This sulfur mask did not work for me Unfortunately I am in the smaller percentile where this mask did opposite of what it claimed I broke out still breaking out in places where I never had acne before I am using All PTR products from the anti aging facial wash to the gel exfoliator and green cooling mask I have to wear the green cooling mask to somewhat calm my skin nightly to counter the acne this mask has given me I wanted to love it and the brand but it is not for me\\nread more I love this mask because it actually works It is one of the only things that quickly gets rid of any acne I get I use it as a mask if my skin is really struggling or as spot treatment if its not as big of a deal The only reason I cant give this mask 5 stars is the smell Its definitely eggy but honestly worth it due to how well it works Unfortunately not as amazing for me as so many others experienced I didnt see much difference I think this plumps rather than hydrates Which is not something my skin needs especially in the cold of winter A wonderfully hydrating serum just wish you got more for what you pay I felt more hydrated but after a day I started breaking out pretty bad For the price point I expected real results and boy it did deliver However as with other PTR products they tend to leave a sort of sticky film which causes me slight breakouts The formula is lightweight loose and non greasy and I noticed immediate results after a few uses with my skin looking noticeably more plump But then again the breakouts I usually love PTR products so I was super excited to try this out I have combosemi sensitive acneic skin so my skin needs the hydration I really wanted to love this product It feels so light on the skin mixes well with other ingredients and you really dont need a lot to go a long way Only thing is I did not find it really quenched my dehydrated skin I went through the entire bottle and really didnt see a difference Save your 60\\nread more Initially felt cooling on my skin but overall did absolutely nothing for it if anything it made my skin actually feel driedout Back to LaMerand dang it I was trying to save money  I hope it works for others I just have difficult skin I guess I thought this was a daily moisturizer The box suggested for daily 2x a day use but this is an exfoliator Contains multiple strong acids It was VERY moisturizing but my face became irritated with daily use and I developed mini red dots all over my face Returned I really like this product Skin feels more hydrated I use it at night before my moisturizer I reeeeeeaaaalllyyyy loved this product but alas I began breaking out a few weeks after I started using it Im fairly sure it was this product that caused me to break out because it was the only change I made to my skincare routine at that time The breakouts were nothing bad at all and they werent really that noticeable but they were still something Id rather do without if I can avoid it I think it might have been that the fragrance irritated my skin a bit since my skin is incredibly picky But the upsides this made my skin feel like a babys bottom My skin has NEVER been as soft and smooth as it was when I used this it felt silky and I could not stop touching it I would say definitely try this out if your skin can handle fragrances Even if your skin is sensitive give it a try You might love it as much as I did\\nread more Unimpressed This product actually made me break out Im African with a fantastic complexion and wanted to maintain it as Im venturing into my 50s and this product has done the opposite Ive had more breakouts than a teenager Cant wait to ship this back Not worth it If I could give this 0 stars I would NOT GOOD FOR COMBO SKIN Does it mattify Yes But it brings out flakiness and dries out my skin Does is make my skin poreless DEFINITELY NOT If anything it brought my pores out more because of the way it dries It made my makeup so cakey and almost each time I tried it I ended up redoing my foundation Overall this is the worst primer i have ever tried And the price tag is like  How did you end up with a 39 price for garbage in a bottle MAYBE this would work if you just have oily skin and no dryness at all and no pores Which good for you if thats you\\nread more I bought this for my mum She has really oily eyelids and because of that EVERY mascara and eyeliner weather it be regular long lasting or waterproof runs on her face I was told by a Sephora employee that this would fix all her problems and it only made things worse Not a bad primer since it is matte Def keeps my make up in place through out the day but i still have to blot my face during midday only once though The only problem i have with this product it is kind of hard to put on and spread through out my faceOther than that def a satisfy customer Very drying pulled up my makeup did not go on smooth Works better with a damp beauty blender if you still want to try it Basically just use this on my forehead because my hair sweeps to the side and I dont like the greasy feel on them I would say I can stay matte for about 4 hours in cooler weather but not necessarily in summer Im not sure if this is normal or if I should be expecting more I have loved this product for YEARS I use to be really oily  had to blot multiple times a day But using this primer i only had to powder for touch ups I do not suggest using this primer if you plan on being bare faced It does leave somewhat of a white cast Primer needs to be spread evenly otherwise you will find patchy spots upon foundation application I think this is a great primer for people in their early to mid 20s Sadly it no longer works for me as i enter my 30s Nothing against the product Just my skin is changing as i get older and am no longer as oily as i use to be\\nread more my face is still shiny but not as shiny Also I feel like it doesnt help diminish size of pores Lastly my foundation and concealer dont want to stay on my face when I have this primer on Overall I would recommend if you have a problem with shiny skin but it doesnt completely remove the shine as I had hoped I have really oily skin but this primer is still too drying on me Sometimes it produces dry patches under my concealer and makes my skin look more textured than it is I would only recommend this with a really dewy or hydrating foundation or the way that I use it by mixing it with a hydrating primer I wish I could give it zero or negative 5 stars This balled up and peeled right off my skin I am very oily and I wish this worked but it did nothing but make me look like my face was peeling after a bad sun burn This primer is for OILY skin I wouldnt recommend it for anyone else Also please read the instructions I didnt at first and thought I hated it Then I read the instructions and applied it correctly and it performed great Highly recommend for oily skin I used this product before I was on Accutane the time in my life where my skin was filled with acne and extremely oily The first day I used it it made my face feel very tight and almost sore The second day I used it it made my face very dry and flakey  it also did not keep my makeup on The third day it made my face burn and even more flakey I would not recommend this product to anyone After day 3 I threw it in the garbage\\nread more Its sticky and it didnt help with my oily t zone it made it more oily I wouldnt recommend the makeup revolution primer is great for oily skin it stayed on for hours and made my face look very matte on top of my foundation this product is the worst very thick and heavy and doesnt blend well it sticky and makes you feel like you are wearing a mask plus it causes breakouts like you wouldnt believe I bought this to calm my rosacea but I honestly like Tatcha products a lot better for soothing Overall I didnt see too much of a difference in my skin Felt nice going on and absorbed nice while not breaking me out but no significant improvements for the price Used the entire sample I didnt notice any improvement in hydration or texture in my 40s combo skin The only good thing is it didnt irritate my sensitive skin I purchased this product because the sales person at Sephora really convicend me to buy it I had gone into the store looking for an eye cream and I was interested in one by tatcha but I ended up purchasing this product in a gift set that included their celery moustirer as well as the tumeric face and body polish I loved this product from the first few weeks I could see an instant glow and extra moisture on my skin that was dull at the time and also ove time I realized I took away some of my hiperpigmentation I was wearing it day and night but now after using it for about 2 months I feel like the effects stopped and it doesnt do anything on my akin amymore which is why Im giving it 3 stars Ive added two photos first one was before the product and the other one was after about a month using it two a day\\nread more No long term effects seen with this product I am pretty oily around my forehead and nose but really dry around my cheeks eyes chin and around my lips As others have mentioned the hydration provided by this product alone is not enough to keep my skin hydrated Not very impressed No noticeable effect on the texture or look of my skin Not that hydrating Not worth the price I have acne scarring and medium combination skin My concerns are oil control redness and scarring I was hoping the water serum would help with oil control but I really dont feel like this serum does anything for my skin The packaging is beautiful but this left my skin gasping for moisture Gonna return Too expensive for it not to work Gave me super bad acne and made my skin greasy everyday I didnt start using it about a month after I got it and it just cause my skin to break out so bad I really hoped this was the new hype that all the people in Sephora were saying but maybe just trying to sell the product Little tough on skin but effective Bought full size after receiving 2 samples in my Play subscription I personally would not go so far to say Botox in a Box for me I did notice a change in my finer lineswrinkles and have been using this product for a few months now Will be trying more products from this brand I truly do not understand the raving reviews this product typically receives I have tried to love it as others do but the only results I get are dry peeling skin with even more visible fine lines and wrinkles OMG this is such an amazing product 1 little peel pad did such damage control it was insane I got this as a sample and i literally ran to buy some asapi give this a four stars only because the price is pretty steep I only used it once on my acneprone skin and could not appreciate much of a difference May be regular use would provide optimum result so Ill look forward to use it again Given all the glowing reviews and the high price tag I had great expectations for this product It did exactly nothing for my skin  no glow no refreshed look no firmness no impact at all Total waste of money Seems to just make my breakouts worse Maybe this formula works for some people but clearly my skin reacts badly Only giving it two stars because the color matching  concealing IS actually good love everything in it BUT i HATE how this shade has yellow undertones PLEASE make this shade without any bogus primary colors I purchase this cause I used they are foundation it was pretty natural it covered some skin but many people cant tell I put on makeup so I loved the foundation But the concealer was a little disappointed me it was thick and not that smooth I only used less than 5 times its been setting there never touched This concealer doesnt stay on my skin for more than 15 minutes It looks for and has full coverage when you first put it on However if you look in the mirror in and hour you look like you never put concealer on in the first place I dont understand how this is a product It just comes off immediately I find this product to be OK as a concealer for under eyes or uneven skin tone  slight redness but it doesnt do anything for me for treating active pimples and is also just soso at covering blemishes up This is honestly a savior for those who have acne or acne scars Thank you BUT can we please get more range Covers my scars really good after two coats Does oxidize though so Ill be purchasing again just a shade lighter this time is all I use it for pretty much my whole face and it lasts me a very long time Considering price and coverage Id say this is a very good product This may be the worst makeup product I have ever used Wanted so badly to love this product as Im always looking for a good coverup for breakouts from time to time After putting it on the blemish the texture instantly becomes pealy as if my skins is dry and product basically falls off At the very least I would hope this product at least would cover up the coloring redness of the blemish and it did not at all\\nread more Wasnt a fan it was too thick and came on very blotchy This does what it says it does it hydrates really well I dont know if its worth the price as I have other products that do the same thing for much less but if you want to splurge do it Only bad thing is I dont love the smell and I find it leave a bit of tacky feeling although its not a problem for me because I layer a different serum on top it might be for some people I realized after I used this that it was the more expensive serumeek that I had sample with such great results I will finish this bottle and then get the other one next time I find the scent of this stronger than I would like but thankfully it is tolerable I was disappointed I wanted to love this but first of all the smell of the lotion was extremely potent and gave me a headache which I am prone to When I put it on I used a pea size squeeze and made sure to be gentle and even I waited for the instant feel of hydration almost 10 mins  I didnt feel very hydrated for the price of 200 my face better feel something immediately I wanted to love this but not worth the money More to come on the eye concentrate\\nread more I really enjoy this product I use many La Mer products but Im disappointed to see the majority of them have gone up in price recently Skin felt hydrated and calmed down Love itJust price is not nice But quality is good for skin For the price Id say theres nothing special about this hydrating serum You might as well buy a serum with a high percentage of hyaluronic acid in it What a disappointment Caviar it is not This is a 10 percent peel A nice lime smell No difference It is not worth 90 dollars for marketing jar Beverly Hills address This is sadly all hype and no innovation More excess for the land fill Shame on me This did absolutely nothing for my skin I wish I could return it dont waste your money Does not work at all Does not do anything do your face Like a t a l l  Everyone at Sephora raves about this product I got a sample of it and used it twice and my skin did feel softer I want to use it more for full results Truly love how this product feels after an hour Skin is so hydrated and glowing Wished I could try samples of his new eye creams Omg the smell is awful I had to throw it away I got a travel sample with the retinol eye cream and I couldnt finish it I usually love his products too I have been using this product for about 6 months and I do not see any improvement It also has a very strong smell After 35 my skin got more sensitive and reactive My face did not like this product Redness and itchiness all over I had to return I think this is a good product for oily normal Combo skin but not for sensitive skin use caution if youre sensitive I am  and it caused burning and tingling and mild redness Which I did not enjoy and returned it for a diff brand I did not see any changes in terms of brightness or firmness after using it for 3 months I do use other products from this brand Im so upset that I spent THIS much money on a serum that didnt do anything for my skin I used this for 6 months and didnt see any difference I havent been impressed with dr Dennis gross brand it has taught me you dont need to spend so much  on skincare for results Ive been looking for a replacement for my discontinued Algenist genius White brightening essence serum I like a multi Tasker with lightening properties some areas of my face have darker patches on the jawline This serum was successful at preventing my dark patches from showing up again However it has exfoliating properties so I cant use it in the morning under makeup I will return to the Algenist Genius Ultimate AntiAging Vitamin C serum or an Origins combo of Mega Dark Spot Correcting Plantscription Anti Aging Power Serum or a Perricone serum I like Dr Gross but I use this product only at night now\\nread more I like this product and always receive compliments when I wear it I get told my skin looks brighter or I look fresh however the texture is sticky and does not sit well on the skin I love Dr Dennis Gross Skincare and I have had great results with the retinol and sulfur mask However the with the Vitamin C I have experienced breakouts and blemishes Ugh this product gave me a rash on my face Its so intense maybe its for mature skin But I used it once and return it It took over a month for my skin to clear Ive tried a few serums containing vitamin C and had great results but for some reason this one falls short I love other Dr Dennis Gross products however this serum is quite tacky leaves a film on my skin and I didnt experience any noticeable improvements in my skin  neither in the brightening nor firming realm Works ok but horrible smell  there are better vitamin C serums like Ole Henriksen that work amazing have better feel and dont smell Also the packaging is deceiving as the bottle is large but if you look its only half full and 1 ounce Ole Henriksen is same or less cost works amazing but 2 ounces Im sure this works for some people but I got an immediate break out If your skin needs the clean clean products I wouldnt recommend this I have combination skin with occasional hormonal breakout around chin This one broke me out on my cheeks and hormonal breakout worsen a bit Already returned it not worth your money im disappointed in this i feel like not many body acne washes are in the market and this was a bust Unfortunately I bought this for a mild acne issue on my shoulders and after using this along with the after spray my acne got much much worse I tried to keep using it hoping it would work but eventually I stopped and as soon as I stopped using it it was much much less bad The price is much too high to take this chance This didnt work for me at all I wish I could return it It will exfoliate but thats about it I am so glad I finally found something to clear my chest and back This stuff works and a little goes a long way It leaves my skin feeling soft and not over dried or stripped I just wish it wasnt so expensive Im using it in prep for my wedding and may not repurchase after get through the wedding day I get really bad acne break outs on my back and sometimes on my chest I was hoping to find cleanser that can lessen my breakouts or even stop them so I tried this one out However it didnt really help much  but Im willing to try out new products I wasnt too happy with this body wash because it didnt completely clear my back acne or help that much If I skipped a day of use my back would break out again I have since been using the 2 salicylic acid body spray by Paulas Choice and my back is nearly clear A higher acid percentage may be what I needed My back has been breaking out uncontrollably as of late and I have absolutely no clue how to make it stop At the recommendation of Sephora I gave this a try I dont feel that its terrible the exfoliation is nice But I have been using this for a month and my back doesnt seem to be improving I think its onto something new next time I found this product to make me break out more as well as start to break out in areas of my back that Id never had issues before I tried both using this is in daily routine and also with 1 to 2 day breaks between use and neither of those approaches made the product more effective for me I was really excited for this product based off the overwhelming amount of positive reviews but this wasnt a win for me\\nread more I got this with high hopes and it just doesnt work I got a spin brush to use with it and it doesnt work Its over priced for what it is since it barely lasts 3 weeks Dont waste your time using it love this product Definitely helped my breakouts on my back and chest Purchased a while back and unfortunately never got around to writing a review This body wash was not worth the price I paid it didnt work in the slightest bit I have minimal acne on my back and chest I read the great reviews on it so I figured Id give it a try I was so excited when I purchased but was ultimately disappointed after the weeks of me using it because it lacked any benefit Would not purchase again not worth it\\nread more Definitely would recommend this product for someone suffering from body breakouts I wouldnt say this clears my acne but definitely calms the skin and keeps the breakouts to a minimum I dont hate this product but it is waaaaaaaaaayyy too gentle to be an effective peel or exfoliator There are much better resurfacing masks out there within the same price range or cheaper Unless youre willing to wait until you finish this bottle to finally see results I recommend you not waste your money and get something with a higher percentage of glycolic acid Good product Doesnt burn like some other glycolic peels nor is it drying like some of the others I see some but not dramatic improvement in my skin tone and texture Interesting texture Not sure if it works My skin felt pretty smooth but a bit overly sensitive afterwards Really more of a 35 stars I think for me this was too gentle I tried it for a few weeks and it didnt really do a ton for me My skin felt a little softer and smoother but nothing near what other peeps have given me The Pros are that it didnt cause any negative reactions no break outs etc not too bad or overpowering of a smell and easy to spread Love this product and has for sure been added to my exfoliating skin routine Its gentle enough to use a couple times a week but strong enough to see a difference in 2 weeks My skin responds really well to glycolic acid and I was recommended to buy this by one of the Caudalie reps that was in the store for an event It is a nice mask but I dont notice any results so probably wouldnt buy it again I was using this serum a few years ago and switched to quite a few different serums that never quite did the job I have combination skin with very dry sections around my chin and cheeks I decided to repurchase as nothing I had used really helped with the dryness and Im glad I did While I cant say its helped with fine line and wrinkles this product paired with my volition moisturizer really helped with the dry areas on my face However I cannot use this serum or any serum or moisturizer for that matter on its own and have to pair with a moisturizer I switched to the rose deep hydration moisturizer and the combo just didnt work for me as I still felt drytightness around my chin area I just bought the lotus day and night cream hopefully they pair nicely together\\nread more This serum feels nice and sinks into your skin quickly but I did not feel like it added any extra oomf to my routine I already use and love the time release hydrating rose cream and that seems to do the trick without the serum added to it I will say this did make my dry skin slightly more hydrated than it would be not using a serum at all but it did absolutely nothing for improving the texture of my skin and did nothing to help my fine lines It never visibly improved the appearance of my skin after using for 6 months disappointing for a serum at this price point I recommend just spending a little bit more for something that will actually make your skin look better\\nread more Its a decent serum Nice and peculiar scent Like the absorption I took the sample of deep hydration face serum yesterday and tried The first time was as night skin care the second time was morning skin care before makeup I had a high expectation at first because I wanted to try the whitening essence of SK2 but the staff of Sephora said that SK2 is not suitable for me He recommended fresh Ok it doesnt matter but I always know that fresh is very gentle meaning nothing feels good to me As a night skin care there is no comment written quickly absorbed I am dry skin but it is not very moisturizing feeling in the morning I used it before makeupafter whole dayI feels it was like a good face primer because it helped me control the oil The price is not worth it\\nread more I wanted to really like this product but after 2 weeks of continual use I noticed it started to make my face sting Then small zits and dry patches of skin started to form I stopped using it but it evolved into a fullon facial rash I had to go see my dermatologist in order to calm down the flareup Just not good with my sensitive skin Not a product for me A lot is needed to do the entire face and neck but the hydratation is good Purchase and paid more for this face serum thinking it was better than the hydration cream rose It is but after Id say about a few hours skin gets really flaky or dry Not super hydrating compared to other items It smelled so nice and I liked how it was easy to apply but it had to impact on my skin I returned it and I never return things but it felt like such a waste of money This really isnt a review I just need to share that I feel like this product is a waste of money This is a nice serum It provides extra moisture and feels really nice on the skin The only downside for me was the strong fragrance Also the packaging isnt my favorite as its difficult to dispense all of the product I use this mainly as a PM serum after putting on a prescription retinoid cream but before putting on my night cream I feel that it helps keep my face from becoming too dry from the treatment I would never use this during the day because I have oily skin and my face would probably look wet because its so hydrating So if youre looking for something for extra moisture for night this would work out Love the feel and great for my skin but the price for the size could be just a bit lower Works good Helped my dry skin all winter I dont know if its working just yet My skin feels better I still have some breakouts on the chin Do not get this in a cut it stings I just dont feel like its doing anything for my acne I want to love it I really do  but I just dont see it doing anything In the top ingredients is Denatured Alcohol I had wondered why it dried my skin out and stung after I washed my face and used toner I couldnt read the ingredients on the bottle too small so I came here and found out about the denatured alcohol I know its bad for my skin and with the stinging and drying of skin I can see why I also broke out more after I used this a few times Beware Ive had adult acne for a few years now and it continues to mystify me I used this as a nightly spot treatment for a month but it did not eliminate my acne Pros didnt wreck my skin no excessive peeling no strong odor Cons I see no difference in scarringdiscoloration I still get acne though maybe slightly less This straight up just did not do anything for my skin at all I have had this recommended to me multiple times for the skin problems I have had and it did nothing to any acne I have had Instead of at the very least keep my acne at bay my acne would even get worse after I started using this Im out 54 for something that did nothing for me I always thought so highly of PTRs product line especially his masks However when I tried this product it made my acne worse than it already was I used it as directed and although it didnt cause my skin to burn I would wake up with more zits than I had the night before I will never ever get this product again as it does not work for my skin which is oily combination and acne prone I had bad hormonal acne at the time that i bought this hoping for it to help at least a little bit from all the good reviews it didnt do anything for my skin besides leaving it smelly and v sticky i used it for about two weeks and saw no results and ended up throwing it out waste of my mula I have nothing nice to say about this product Its expensive it failed to improve my skin in any way its harsh and drying and the vapor stung my eyes with each application I may as well have been slathering my face with hand sanitizer Perhaps Peter Thomas Roth AHABHA Acne Clearing Gel is helpful for some people but its a resounding NO from me I have sensitive combination acne skin so I wanted something that would really help my concerns this product is great because it extremely reduced my prescription and acne without extremely drying out my skin A little goes along and it lasts forever Love the brands mask Decide to give this a try No results whatsoever Ive been using this for almost a year now and Ill say that it is drying But after a couple of days of use my acne does reduce in size and if I use 23x daily it will stay about 80 clear but its so drying ugh I dont know if Ill re purchase Ive taken these for years and they used to work very well My skin was bright and my acne went away and I would get compliments on my skin If ever I would stop taking them my skin would break out so I could tell that these were working However the formula has changed more recently and the tablets are smaller and look different These stopped working for me and my skin is now breaking out terribly even taking the full dose multiple bottles in Extremely disappointing considering the price point I do not plan to continue to purchase\\nread more I have noncystic hormonal acne and Im on my third bottle of this because I needed to try it for at least three months to see the results This unfortunately hasnt done anything for my skin No difference whatsoever but Im sure the vitamins in the supplement are helpful for optimal health anyway Still disappointed because the price point is high I was really hoping this product would work I saw no change after a couple months I purchased an item from that worked much better and much cheaper I was a little disappointed because Ive tried everything from drug store acne products to proactiv and none have worked for my skin Ive suffered with acne since I was about 14 now 27 and only 1 product has really helped me Benzaclin I havent been able to visit a dermatologist but I intend to I really had hope this product would work but Ive had better results applying aloe Vera to my face Yes I was consistent and showed no results Good luck to you all but it really didnt work for me\\nread more I have been using this product for many years and it did work for my acne Recently Murad decided to change the ingredients they lowered the dose and took some stuff out including vitamin B2 Im very disappointed now they dont work anymore my acne is not going away Broke me out with tiny red bumps all over my face  Mostly in places I never break out in like my foreheadsooooooooo its a big huge no  a pass for me Didnt work i used it fir two week I never had severe acne I just always had hormonal acne around my chin which was finally starting to clear up I decided to order these to see if I could finally have perfect skin but it made me break out EVERYWHERE They werent like regular pimples They were tiny little bumps all over my face and my arms and they were very red Took about a month for it to clear up Be cautious I took 2 bottles and I still dont see better Disappointed but know that no medicine work with everyone Pricey and does not work at all I purchased the full Murad 30 day kit along with this My breakouts are getting worse why would you overcharge a product that does not work at all it made my face worse  Ive definitely noticed that it has reduced redness that I have on my cheeks I enjoy the consistency it is nice and light and is an easy addition to my night time skin routine My only hesitancy about repurchasing is that the price point is higher than I would normally spend I was expecting this to be more of a serum but it has a creamy consistency I also thought it would be moisturizing but it wasnt at all It did not make my skin more red but it didnt help either I have been using this product for about a month now and really do not see any change or improvement in the redness in my skin I like this product Its like a light moisturizer but I wear it under other moisturizers and it doesnt help with rednessitchiness on my cheeks not rosacea just sensitivedry I like the smell too reminds me of neroli I only gave it 4 stars because its a little pricey but if you buy it with the 20 its not terrible It leaves my skin really hydrated I can even out it on and Ill be fine without putting on moisturizer but damn does it make me break out I put some behind my ear to make sure it was the serum and yep got a zit behind my ear sadly I have to keep using it This is so milky that it didnt really soak into my skin this serum broke me out  even really working on my redness It was sad but I had to return it the breakouts were all over and hurting Still would recommend for somebody whos not sensitive Purchased this whole line during the VIB sale because my tried and true regimen had started causing me to have red itchy flare ups suddenly This was recommended to me by the Sephora skin guru and it has really helped calm and soothe my irritated skin I would definitely recommend this to anyone suffering from irritated skin Ive been using this twice a day for 3 weeks and havent noticed any change in the blotchy redness I have around my cheekbones and up towards my temples Just doesnt seem to be doing anything at all  a shame given the price and especially after I received a free product replacement when my first order showed up with a broken cap Dont think Ill be repurchasing Its ok did not see any difference I bought this to help with some redness on my cheeks I SO wanted to love this but I used it once and it immediately broke me out and made my skin all itchy Its over a week later and Im still trying to get my skin back to normal The texture and smell are nice and its a clean product which I love so Id just encourage you to do a patch test before committing to putting it all over your face My skin just didnt react well to it but it might work for other people\\nread more This did absolutely nothing to calm my redness It was not worth the hefty price tag I absolutely love the scent and the product feels great on my face Im honestly not seeing much of a difference but its cooling This serum is one of the most moisturizing serums I have ever used Instead of a clear gel consistency it is milky and feels like a moisturizer It doesnt leave skin feeling tight after drying and does help with redness Great herbal scent as well I wanted to love So bad that I kept using after I seen the signs Ive never been one to break out Now I have red blotches all over my face at first gave my skin a little breakout but once my skin gets used to it it really moisturizes and smooths the skin love the idea of mixing vitamin C yourself since it isnt very shelf stable love the product hate the price Was excited to try this in my acneprone skin that has red marks leftover from old pimples What am I missing This did absolutely nothing It smelled good though Very rarely are products the real deal This one is definitely one of them Adding a few drops to my moisturizer daily brightened my skin so significantly that it mimicked the look of wearing a highlighter Got so many compliments on my skin The problem is that this product is not sustainable  its ridiculously priced and only a 7 day use because it starts to oxidize rendering itself useless Wish there were more Vitamin C booster options in store I likely will not buy again simply because its not friendly on the wallet \\nread more Really small print that this needs to be used within 7 days of opening so more than half of the product is wasted unless you smear it all over This stuff is pretty good The price is ridiculously high to me though I like the scent of the product After two days of using it morning and night my skin looks so bright My dark spots seem to be gradually fading I look like Im glowing The thing I hate us the packaging Its so darn messy It seems like too much product can spill it and this stuff is too expensive to waste I probably would purchase again if I had extra money\\nread more I used this for one week and i have to admit i did see a difference It did not fade any dark spots however my skin had more colour and glow to it The reason i am giving this 3 starts is because the price is outrageous 27 FOR ONE WEEKS SUPPLY The container has a lot of product in it but the vitamin c expires 7 days after opening The packaging is also cheap product leaks from it or too much squirts out at once\\nread more Dried my skin out even though I was using as directed and only every two days to ease into it I did not see the promised positive results I went to Sephora for something to help with my acne dicoloration and was recommended this product Its very moisturizing even gives you a glow but besides that this product was not that helpful The packaging tells you that if you want the best effect on your skin you have to buy multiple of this product it only last a little over a week because of the unstable vitamen C I love clinque i think its a great brand but I gave this product three stars mainly because I was mislead when buying this product\\nread more Was hoping that this product will help lighting my dark spots but instead it whitens my entire face lol Will try for longer once the winter comes Expensive wasteful packaging and zero results Used for over a month and literally no change The feeling of heat on your pores is nice and it did remove many of my blackheads but the blackheads always returned I need something that can diminish the blackheads and keep them out I bought this from Clinique a while ago to tackle the sebum that is always on my noseonly visible pore area It is easy to apply honestly ignore the bad reviews about that 1 Lightly dampen your problem area with cool water 2 Unscrew the white cap and squirt out a tiny bit you dont need much 3 Dab on the cream It heats up in contact with the water 4 Screw on the whiteblue cap 5 Rub the ridged end of the cap onto the area with some pressure 6 Rinse off and apply toner  continue your routine The instructions say to put the cream on first and then water because if youre not careful it will slide off so you can also do cream first and then water This is just my preference to feel more of the heat I use it 34 times per week and a bottle lasts for a few months I notice that the creases in my nose are clearer but I still have daily sebum issues So this doesnt solve the problem just halves it Overall I recommend it\\nread more This product doesnt work was a waste of money Im not sure why Cliniques products have gone down the drain I dont see a difference at all but Ill keep on using it If anything changes when I finish it then Ill change my rating Didnt work at all form me None of the blackheads disappeared as I scrubbed it on  was returned Havent really noticed much of a difference really And usually the day after use I find that the blackheads have turned into actual zits Took me a bit to figure it out Then when it actually warmed I felt it didnt do what it said Disappointed with the product no difference Too much for what little it does you can find one similar that would work better at CVS It says to put water after applying it but it actually works better if you tap some water on your face and then apply this Yes I feel the heat But did nothing for my pores and blackheads I was excited to try this and no good results didnt see much I used it for almost 3 weeks every 23 days I returned it Didnt notice much of a difference in the black heads on my nose and chin Very disappointed but I like the head to it really makes you feel clean Get a sample first it works differently on everyone The sample amount was enough for two people I got it originally for my boyfriend because he gets really bad and painful black heads I noticed a huge improvement on him first use so I bought it I started using it but it took a few uses to notice an improvement on myself I think the directions are not very well thought out as the product worked best if my skin is damped before application This is a product where consistancy propper application and thoughrough massage is necessary If you cant dedicate the time there are easier products out there\\nread more The heating aspect feels nice it does feel like a good exfoliator however I didnt notice a difference in terms of getting rid of blackheads or preventing them This product minimizes pores to an extent However it doesnt extract blackheads as most would have hoped when purchasing The price is outrageous for the size of the bottle  and for that reason would never purchase again A fair price would have been 2227 not 39 Would highly recommend other products at the same price point Doesnt do what was advertised Comes with a weird applicator that does not work with applying the product It does heat up a little bit but delivers 0 results Such a waste of money I had a hard time understanding its usage method from the packages explanation Had to look for YouTube reviews which are just a few for a good reason  not only is it hard to get but its also its application However the result after all the fuzz is not bad it does its job Would I buy it again No This kind of helps with wrinkles or at least helps with preventing them from getting worse Im 27 years old Im on my 3rd bottle I like that it does not irritate my eyes but it is so expensive Also Im surprised more people are not talking about the packaging flaw The first time I bought it I didnt not check but the second time after I was not getting any product through the pump I opened it up and the pump straw was bent and split open and there was still a lot of product left in the bottle Same thing with my third bottle so I think it is a package flaw Disappointed because this is so expensive\\nread more I wanted this to help with wrinkles and under eye darkness It seemed to work to help puffiness But it wore off about 1 hour later It wasnt hydrating enough to last the day Im sure if I had waited the 10 days I may have saw a difference Also there was a slight burning sensation This eye serum did mot work for me The first two uses it seemed fine no changes but no issues The last time I used it I woke up the next morning to puffy irritated eyes My under eyes looked worse To be fair I began using this product as a preemptive strike against aging It has done a good job making my under eye concealer last longer but overall my under eye looks about the same The pump makes for a hygienic product but fails to pump out the cream after a certain point Be sure to unscrew the top and get product out because there will be plenty inside It has helped some in reducing puffiness but Im still looking for a better product Havent seen any real results but I love the formula Some eye creams cause burning this one hasnt I wish I could rate this product It was never delivered and after inquiring twice Ive never heard back regarding my order I wanted to love this because I enjoyed Algenists liquid collagen This doesnt cut it as an undereye serum Its a good moisturizer for the eyes but nothing more It will not impact any fine lines or affect the texture of skin under the eyes Im sure there are better products out there for 90 Wish I hadnt missed the return deadline Im 28 and dont have many issues with my eyes besides very fine lines I used this religiously for over two months and noticed absolutely no difference I took before pictures and compared them and all my lines are still there and visible It was nice and moisturizing but for the price tag definitely not worth it Have been using this for a month now and like its soothing to the eye area I cant say that every line around my eyes is gone but I will continue using it Also its one of the few serums good to use on eyelids I have been using this for a few weeks now and my eyes actually look worse Glad it works for some of you but stuff you get at drug stores are just as good I use a nickel sized amount all over my face and neck Allow 1 min to absorb Use with a firming moisturizer and it will delay deeper wrinkles from forming Ive used this combo for about 2 yrs now So sticky 15 minutes after applying my face is still tacky This is not as good as I expected I would not buy it again Im not sure if it improved my skin but it was sticky and made my face shiny I will not buy again I use their corset cream all the time and definitely love it The serum has a for sure tightening effect but I found it left a bit of residue Would just stick with the cream next time The cap doesnt close tight Thats the only down side Everything else is very good Its a good product but it doesnt do what my other serum does Probably good for younger skin 20s or 30s I hated the bottle so much I couldnt even give the product a fair review terrible design The first one I received leaked all over the box The replacement was packed like a Faberge egg still leaked Cannot travel with it totally impractical Ill stick with the Rose This works well to fill in deep lines It soaks into the skin quickly Not for oily girls I have a combo skin prone to breakouts and guess what  this made me break out  I also didnt like the consistency of the serum  it was too liquid to my liking It smells nice just like their other products though Based on all good reviews may be I should try this product in a decade when I really will have to use age delay products instead of acne products I loved the sample  I saw results So I got the real deal Im using it faithfully but no further results Ill use it up since there are no negative effects but its a disappointment Love it the scent and the moisture The only con is lasting time very short it lasts me only one and half month Dont really know about firm but it leaves your face feel nice and smooth Absorbs into the skin almost instant no greasy feeling I found this hydrating and I loved the smell It was a pleasure to use but I didnt notice any visible difference using it I bought it for antiaging benefits and the only one it satisfies is hydrating the skin to help prevent wrinkles Maybe good for someone in their 20s as prevention My dehydrated aging combo skin needs more Wont repurchase but its a nice product imo I decided to take a break from my usual serum the Sunday Riley Luna Night Oil and was recommended this Resveratrol Lift Firming Serum After my 3rd application of this stuff my skin felt and looked horrible Im talkin fine lines and dry patches that became even more noticeable under make up I waited a few days for my skin to go back to normal and returned it This is a NO for me and my skin Sounds so promising but fragrance linalool and limonene are not good for your skin and other organs See information about this at the Environmental Working Groups website Cosmetics Database I want skincare that is truly green Companies want a lot of greenbacks for antiaging products They need to earn your trust Love it but too small and too expensive An Instagram blogger I love recommended this product I like it it smells nice and is plumping but dont expect miracles I mix it I to my Josie Maran moisturizer it add anti oxidants I love the eye lifting from the same line and use that for the whole face This one does not work for me for liftingwrinkle 2 stars because has a great texture I tried for 8 months This product did not do much for my skin and it only lasted me a couple of months even when using a minimum amount each time Much of the product was stuck to the bottom and I couldnt get it out I have used other Caudalie products and have been pleased This one is not worth the money HAVE ONLY BEEN USING THE CAUDALIE LINE FOR A FEW MONTHS I LIKE THE RESULTS SO FAR THEIR PRODUCTS ARE GENTLE BUT EFFECTIVE I USE THIS SERUM 1ST THEN I APPLY THE PREMIUM CRU CREAM WHEN ALL IS ABSORBED I APPLY MY SUNSCREEN This Serum works very well on large pores make them smaller and the skin looks more firm Even if I dont see my face it really lifts up I hope this will happen soon because Ive been using it for two weeks Received as a sample not a bad product but didnt really notice much difference Had a nice consistency and applied nicely but wasnt anything really different from other products I used this produce consistently for 2 weeks no results It made me break out much more than normally in places I havent on my face before My skin breaks out every time I use this product Ill finish the tube but will not purchase again Ill stick w their acne and wrinkle reducing serum Pretty indifferent with this product The only thing it seemed to do for me was make my skin feel textured It didnt seem to help my breakouts especially cystic acne at all It didnt do anything for my acne at all I like the light gel texture of it I use it morning and night and its not making my acne worse but its also not really stopping break outs either Im going to keep using it until it runs out because it wasnt cheap but its not making that much of a difference When I first bought this product I was so excited to get rid of the breakouts I have on my forehead So I used it for a solid 23 weeks and it worked really well Like my acne was completely gone However at one point it just stopped working It was as if I was never even using the product in the first place I took about a one month break from using it to see if it would work again I began using the product again and consistently put it on for about a month Nothing changed and my acne stayed the same I was really disappointed because it was really helping out in the beginning \\nread more I used this product for a few weeks on my acne and it did not make a difference on inflammation irritation or actual size of my acne Its an expensive product and I have found a much better and cheaper alternative as a spot treatment I was hoping this would help control my acne unfortunately its not strong enough for me My skin is oily and my acne is very stubborn Once I get a pimple it will be there for at least a week This definitely didnt work for me but Im sure it worked for many other people Love this Ive struggled with acne for three years and nothings worked this has Only setback is after i got another bottle for some reason it didnt work Not sure what happened but im gonna give it another go since the first time i used it was over night my break outs were gone the next day Not bad Added a bit of moisture but didnt see any difference in my skin after a month of testing I was recommended this product by a lady at Sephora The product did not work for me at all I started breaking out even more It did not heal my breakouts even a tad bit I wish I could return it I love this product Ive been using it for about a month now and I already see a huge difference in the texture of my skin I got this as part of the 30day set and for the first month or so everything worked and my acne did decrease but then went back to how it was Before this I had only tried drugstore salicylic acid and thought that using a higher end salicylic acid product would work but I guess SA is not the cure to my acne I enjoy the gel texture that glides easily onto my skin when I apply it I have combination acneprone skin that started flaring up after college graduation Since then Ive been trying to find products to help clear it up once again I already had an established routine that was working slowly over time of course but when I started implementing this treatment as well I feel like it was working really well in conjunction A little bit goes a long way so itll last quite a while\\nread more Works so well The moisturizer works great and the cleanser is amazing I love this line of KS products I have problematic skin The cleanser it perfect I see results from every use Its not very thick and it doesnt lather up too much doesnt get soapy But it works well The moisturizer is very light but I imagine good 4 the skin The drying lotion I havent tried yet But Ive tried almost exact products by Mario B and Indee Lee  The Mario B  IL work as promised This is a great kit to try out KS products The packing box is re useable Its a cute lil box with logo tissue paper\\nread more I want to say I liked the products in general but it stained my face pink even though I washed my face with a different cleanser I have pink splotches all over my face The moisturizer was nice and the face wash it didnt dry out my skin The Toner acne treatment I used to spot treat my problem areas are PINK So far really like this product Ive been using for for a week and my acne has cleared up a lot It burned a lot in the beginning but now my skin is used to it This mini set is very small I expected the cleanser to be way bigger I thought that it was working but after 2 weeks my skin began to get itchy and bumpy on my cheeks Im not sure if the acne cream treatment works The spot treatment is ok It sort of works but doesnt clear a zit over night The moisturizer is not enough for my skin It left my skin feeling very dry I needed to put some of my aveno cream on my face and it fixed it up but still bumpy I am very disappointed in this product I thought this could cure my acne Im going to try First aid beauty next I give it 2 stars because the cleanser wasnt nearly as bad as the yes to face wash I tried out\\nread more Ive used parts of this kit before I like the face wash it feels like it drys out the oil and the salicyclic acid was light and had a slight tint but none of these stopped my breakouts that I would get from time to time  love the spot treatment cleanser and other treatment however the moisturizer isnt anything special and the retinol treatment ran out way before all the other products At first this was a miracle for me My skin was becoming a blemish free Yet I think with constant use my skin became used to all the products Which led to no more effective results The face wash and spot treatment are my holy grail products They are the only things that have been able to completely clear my skin so far I cant tell if the aches treatment does anything but it definitely didnt hurt Ive used up the entire bottle and it lasted me about 55 months The texture is a strange runny gel and I didnt really care for the scent Because it has a slippery gel texture I found that it didnt sink into my skin easily and I had to really work it in On the plus side it never left my skin feeling sticky or greasy I didnt see much results but I did like this for mixing other products I love the Ordinary vitamin c suspension moisturizer but thats rather strong alone So I would mix that with this serum and it was divine Overall its an ok serum but Ive tried better and wont be repurchasing\\nread more My bf would never spend on products like this so I got this as a gift for him and he loved it Hes very picky about what he puts on his face sensitive skin but once he tried this he fell in love it He saw improvement in his skin in days and liked how soft it left his skin Ive tried it myself on a few occasions and find that it works just as well as any of my regular serums that I use and yassss It made my skin feel so soft Must try\\nread more I wanted to try this out due to the reviews Ive been using it religiously for months with ZERO results Pretty disappointed considering how expensive it is Its a nice serum that feels very hydrating but I havent noticed any long term results Im doing 4 stars purely because I think this is the only JB product Im using I think is a bit pricey However I like the texture of this serum thin without being completely watery I only need one pump to cover my whole face especially if used right after the toner and it does absorb pretty well Leaves a slight tacky sensation after drying but Ive found that goes away once I use my moisturizer I dont have a lot of wrinkles but I do feel the ones developing on my forehead are minimizing and not getting worse\\nread more SUPER drying Dont use if you plan on putting on makeup the next day It does its job but my skin was pretty flakey afterwards Id rather use a pimple patch Great as a mask for shrinking pimples and dealing with acne Waaaaaaay to harsh for spot treatment overnight I learned the hard way and made two little pimples into a bigger thinggkk Giving this product 3 stars because while it does dry out pimples quickly its super drying If you use this as an overnight spot treatment beware that the skin around the pimple will be red It also causes flaking skin if you use it too often on the same spot I received this as a free sample I had no idea that it was this expensive I have to say that my rosaceaacne responds rather well to this but the sulfur smell isnt worth the return especially at this price point I wouldnt count it out if you arent sensitive to smell and your acnerosacea responds well to sulfur based treatment think Prosacea x 10 I liked this mask and use it when my skin has a breakout of gets congested but I cant honestly say that it does anything more for both issues than a charcoal mask I also think its gotten less effective after a few months which is not the case for my charcoal masks I like it but not enough to justify repurchasing for the price Didnt feel any allergic reaction during the 30 min I kept it on but once I washed it off w water I saw my skin was very blotchy and red I got this as a sample and all I can say is that if you want your face to stink like sulfur aka the smell of rotten eggs and inhale that for the rest of the night then be my guest There are plenty of other acne treatments that dont stink up your entire day or your face that work just as well if not better I really want to love this product I wish I read the reviews about not using this an an overnight mask because I did that last night and woke up this morning to red patches in the spots where I applied the mask I dont even have sensitive skin so it speaks to how potent this stuff is I didnt find the smell to be unbearable and when I used it as a 2030 min mask I felt it did help with my acne I think I need to figure out how to best use because I do feel it is effective but Im not looking to get these chemical burns after every use\\nread more This product has turned into my 1 overnight spot treatment I apply a thin layer before I go to sleep and probably 810 times the pimple is definitely diminished Believe me if this was a clear gellike spot treatment it would be my day time spot treatment as well The only learning curve is how intense the ingredients are My first time the mask burnedtingled a little bit but the more you get used to it the better it becomes I would be sure to moisturize in the morning when you rinse off the spot treatment to get your glow back\\nread more The product is super strong so if you have sensitive skin do not use The mask reduce the appearance of my blemishes but it dried my skin completely out I was not recommend using overnight like I did That was a big mistake If you are going to use the mask just make sure you put on a good moisturizer afterwards Tried it because Jeffree star but did not work Dried my skin out and absolutely did not work This works great as a treatment mask for 2030 minutes but I wouldnt leave it on overnight I used it as a spot treatment and woke up with a little bit of more than normal redness around said blemishes Nothing a little concealer cant fix but was a little strange I enjoyed it otherwise and it didnt feel drying at all which was nice Absolutely does not work Im pretty sure the other reviews are coming from the company itself The only thing this product is great for is leaving your skin smelling like sulfur for the rest of the day Theres so many other products that are far less expensive that actually work Didnt help with acne You can find same ingredients for less money Before getting into anything else this mask works very well I wouldnt suggest it if you only have a few isolated pimples bit if youre experiencing breakouts this will really help speed their process along I love how intense the cooling sensation is while it dries it definitely feels nice on hot feeling acne That being said this mask smells putridwhich is to be expected because it is sulfurbut it even leaves my face smelling like sulfur for hours after The scent is so strong that it definitely could dissuade someone from enjoying the products benefits so I would suggest getting the mini size first The second star I took off is for the price I understand that you pay for quality products but I dont think that the amount of product that you get justifies the pricetag\\nread more I dont see what the hype is all about The cream does nothing and smells strongly of perfume I cant see any benefits after I first use this product and it made me have 45 breakouts the other morning I am 26 combinedry skin I expected a lot because it was so popular and high rated but it really wasnt that good to me I rather buy another La prairie sleeping mask It is a little pricey but at least it dose the job Its fair i am not sure Pricy Nope but the amount is small so it seems like not cheap if you calculate by per oz About the effect I have almost finished one of three nothing change I believe so far however nothing bad at the moment First time I heard about this is from some Asian beauty bloggers and its hard to imaging how popular this is in Asia Since the price tag is great I bought four of these during sale event It states in Guerlains website that it could NOT be used every night max three times per week so even its only half ounce per tube it will still last me a long time So far I used about six times as l stay up late all the time I could not say it magically fixed my night owl look but I did wake up with a bit well rested glow just not last long I guess this would be great for someone that go to bed early regularly and use it for first aid on random stay up late nights\\nread more I know this is not an every day use type of cream but I definitely did not see the results they hype up The smell is nice but for the size I would not repurchase I read many glowing reviews for this night cream so I was really shocked when I tried it and it didnt do anything for me I didnt care for the smell and I just didnt like how it felt on my face You know how sometimes youll put a product on your face and you feel like ew this feels cheap I wish I didnt just put this on my face thats how I felt about this one I cant understand what others liked about this product\\nread more This is a sample sized product I liked the silly texture and the loved that it moisturized my skin but thats about it As someone who tends to pull a lot of late night works and allnighters this is awesome to put on before a nap or just a few hours of sleep It doesnt solve all the problems but it does even out my skin tones and soothes some blemishes Unfortunately this product did not work for me Im 38 with combooily skin  it made me breakout I liked the smell  silk texture but I feel it never absorbed completely into my skin The 5 nights I used it I didnt notice any benefits that next morning but I did notice greasy skin  clogged pores  Love this product Cleared up most of my acne scars within 2 weeks It is a bit drying I use it with the Murad pore control moisturizer I purchased this about 3 months ago and mixed with a Vitamin C serum I had from Garnier I used every night and noticed no change at all When I used it by itself it was really sticky Ive been using this product for a little over 2 months now and I do think it works It has definitely lightened up the scars on my cheeks forehead and chin I would say I noticed the difference fairly early on atleast 34 weeks into using it I still put it on mainly because there are still a few stubborn dark areas around my smile lines that havent caught up Also I noticed sometimes the gel tends to bleed outside the dark area I dotted it on and there will be like a halo effect of lighter skin around the spot Which obviously I wasnt trying to do so Im having to put really small tiny dots on the inner most dark area The other thing I noticed is that as the spots start to fade they also turn a little red so now Im seeing more faded red spots than anything I put on spf 70 everyday before I leave the house just to make sure I dont cause irritation But honestly I think the gel causes irritation anyway especially if you have sensitive skin It can sting a little if you have open scar or picked recently All in all this product is good it works and it does as it is advertised Ive tried so many other dark spot correctors Ambi Clinique and Proactive to name a few and theyve never made a difference in my skin like Murad has I find Im at a point that I could go make up free on my cheeks chin and forehead if I wanted to I just need these darn smile lines to catch up\\nread more I did not see any difference I wish it worked for me If someone could reply to this msg that would be awesome Please tell me if you are experiencing the same thing  I put the product on at night and in the morning my acnecysts scars are MUCH lighter Then I wash off the product apply my morning moisturizer and makeup and then the scars are back to being super dark If anyone is reading this and going through the same thing please let me know and what are you doing to help it\\nread more This seems to be effective speeding up the process of repairing color changes in skin where a blemish has come and gone This works with lighter spots but dont expect a dramatic difference I used the entire bottle and saw only small differences Will not be purchasing again but I plan to try the orange version offered by Murad Im pretty sure this made me break out I had clear skin started using this and had little white heads everywhere Definitely returning Did absolutely nothing I used this as advised for 6 months The only fading I saw in my pigmentation no change outside of what is normal Maybe this will work for your skin but it just really didnt for me If I get a pimple I usually have a scar from it for about 2 months so I figured Id give Murad a shot first time using the brand but I know its one of the best when youre trying to aggressively get rid of somethingespecially for acne Anyway I really liked the gel but I couldnt use it everyday because I started to get a rash where I was applying the gel AKA the spot was getting bigger Id still recommend this if youre trying to combat acne scaring because it really does do the trick just be aware if you have sensitive skin as the healing process will likely take longer compared to people who can use it everyday\\nread more For how much this product costs I was expecting more than what I got which was nothing This didnt work for me at all I actually noticed my postacne scars go away quicker when I wasnt using it I dont feel that this did me any good and I am very bummed I didnt return it when I had the chance  I kept holding out hope for it to work So bummed that this hasnt worked for me like it has for other reviewers Ive been using this product every night for 4 months and my dark spots from blemishes havent improved at all Ill continue using until I finish the bottle I guess but it doesnt seem to be working on me The real name for Glycerin is Glycerol identifying it for what it really is  an alcohol OL is the ending of alcohol group of chemical compounds As any other alcohol Glycerin is a degreaser  it absorbs lipids oils and removes them from your skin Many people mistakenly think that because Glycerin has a sleek feel to it it must be moisturizing In fact nothing could be further from the truth The sleekness of Glycerin is a result of the length of the molecules They are much longer than regular alcohol rubbing alcohol for example and therefore feel differently To explain how drying Glycerin really is lets just mention that it has 3 groups OH the degreasing groups while rubbing alcohol only has 1 group OH So Glycerin is much stronger than rubbing alcohol in its degreasing drying action Strong collagen in your skin is what prevents skin from sagging and developing wrinkles Collagen is built from lipids So your skin needs lipids to remain looking young and firm Glycerin robs your skin of its lipids removing them when you remove the product off your skin Instead of helping your skin Glycerin deprives it of much needed lipids and we see the collagen levels drop creating wrinkles and sagging\\nread more I love this serum It really kept my face nice and moisturized But I think its really overpriced for what it can do There are other cheaper products that give you the same result I used the whole bottle and this did absolutely NOTHING for my skin I felt no difference maybe my skin was a bit smoother but thats a big MAYBE absolutely not worth the price Im disappointed as I love Kiehls This product felt like petroleum jelly and never sunk into my skin It left a waxy coat on my face that clogged my pores On a really bad note I used this in combination with the calendula foaming cleanser the dark spot corrector and the brightening moisturizer and I broke out in a combination of massive and microscopic cystic bumpsache all over the lower half of my face in just 4 days In addition it also looks like Ive gotten a chemical burn as my face has darkened and has light and dark areas around my eyes and cheeks Furthermore my pores are huge and my face now has a bumpy texture Im not saying this all came about from this product alone but I want you all to be wary of all of these so called hypoallergenic products All this damage occurred in just 4 daysnot cool I returned everything but now I am left with dark spots Ive never experienced a breakout of this magnitude I usually only get one or two bumps The attached picture is my face recovering after 3 days of using Amorepacific products\\nread more Ive been using this serum for the last two weeks and although I love how it makes my skin feel I cant tell if its actually working I definitely feel that its hydrating my skin and that its pulling moisture to keep my skin nice and healthy Im not seeing any bit of plumpness Its got a good texture in the sense that its water based and is very lightweight on the skin Although I havent seen any results I still recommend it to anybody who is a little dry and needs a little bit more moisture pull\\nread more I tried this because I like a lot of kiehls products but this one did not moisturize or hydrate and seemed to sit on the skin vs sinking in It felt more like a smoothing primer than a skincare item My first bottle I used it all over my face as written Through constant use it did its job in hydrating and smoothing my face a bit but I decided to focus on an essence instead of a serum So for your face I would say its a take it or leave it product However a sales lady at a LOréal outlet store told me that its gentle enough to use under your eyes and thats where it shines And she was right Im currently using it as an eye serum or sometimes by itself and it is SO good It really boosts my dehydrated eye area and is a better alternative to the Shiseido eye concentrate serum also a good product but I would recommend this more Its a good travel product for short trips where you dont want to pack a lot since it can double as eye and face care Just bought another bottle during the sale\\nread more The texture feels exactly like a primer I dont like the texture at all didnt see any difference neither Made me break out like crazy and pretty sure it caused a major eczema flare up It had a bit of a slimy feel to it and felt like it just sat on my skin never seemed to absorb Gross Pitched it immediately Got this as a sample initially and LOVED it I used half of one of the sample pouches on my face so really used a generous amount and WOW I was glowing hydrated dewy and flawless When I saw the cost was 59 I was hesitant at first and I definitely wont buy this again Two pumps really does nothing for your skin and its hard to justify using more at that cost You want it to last I havent seen any crazy dramatic difference but I do love how it feels and the appearance it gives my skin If this was 2530 I would buy it consistently but I cant justify the price for the less than incredible results I live at 7200 ft elevation and its super dry up here so this has definitely saved me and I have used it both with makeup without and at night and consistently get soft hydrated skin It pairs well with a moisturizer if youre really needing some hydration but its almost just a fancy primer under makeup If youve got the extra cash Id definitely recommend trying this product The only real negative is the cost\\nread more I have very sensitive skin but i wanted a little bit more moisture This didnt work for me it broke me out into little bumps It feels like a primer and not like a serum it helps clear my pores out  leaves my complexion looking brighter however dont fly with it even if its in your carryon  unfortunate lesson i had to learnthe pressure change somehow caused the top of the gel bottle to loosen  my liquids bag was filled with it  LOVE this and have purchased many times Only downside for me is I always run out of the activating serum before the scrubbing crystals are gone I TRY to be frugal with the serum but Im always left with scrub ti try to figure out what to do with Would love if they provided more of the activator This makes my face so smooth and poreless I do notice that I always have a couple of new bumps after I use this though I really do like this product Every time that Ive used it it left my skin feeling silky smooth Ive used it on and off for about 8 years Let my sister try it the first time that I bought it and she still uses it on a regular basis too My only issue with it is that I really do need to use measuring spoons I also really wish that it came with more of the liquid too Plus its pretty expensive The peel made my skin soft and smooth for couple of days but I was looking for more than that I was hoping to get some glow and reduction in dark spots caused by acne which I did not get for the price I paid Also I did not see much improvement in pores or fine lines either I had read all of the positive reviews and decided to try this I really like DDGs line of skin care I didnt really notice any significant changes from using this like I had with the Sunday Riley Good Genes Cost was a factor as to why I did not rebuy Good Genes Im thinking that in the future I will just need to save up and continue to buy GG Maybe this worked well for others but not so much for me To be clear this product works It will give you results and it doesnt murder your skin with redness during use as a person with combo skin However it is way too expensive for what it is and you can find the key ingredients in other less fluffy formulas Also if you have dry skin this formula will not do you favors Will it work Yes Worth the price No I believe I notice a firmer looking skin when I use this at night once it quickly blends in I sometimes add a hydrating serum as well After using this religiously I saw no noticeable results For the price I was very disappointed Used four weeks 0 results waste of money Does not even soften the skin like many high end serums I dont know what I was thinking when I spent 110 on this product I wish I decided to return this earlier but at this point they wouldnt accept it back I havent noticed anything different while using this serum I used it regularly Nothing at all Even when I would put it on my face You usually feelsee something you at least see you have a product on your face But with this its like I put air on my face When you touch the skinyou feel nothing No softness firmness oilinessdry skin nothing When you wake up next morning same I decided to finish the bottle just because I payed a lot and couldnt return it and who knows a miracle might happen Although I wasnt expecting a miracle when I bought it I expected something But no I feel so stupid Please save your money and do not invest in this product because it will not do anything for you\\nread more Noticing improvements already I recently purchased this and have been using it for about 2 weeks as part of my nighttime skin routine I have normalcombination skin slightly oily this product doesnt dry my skin out like regular retinol Ive also noticed that my makeup also looks a lot smoother since incorporating this product I'"

for me I have combination oily skin This is my holy grail face wash I use it every single day twice a day and it leaves my face feeling so smooth every single wash In the mornings when I dont want as much exfoliating power I rub it between my palms for longer than usual which creates a nice gentle lather I forgot this at home when I went to Mexico for a vacation and noticed a distinct difference in my skin texture for the worse without it I have acne prone skin and it never has broken me out I got my mom addicted to this as well Its so so good\\nread more Best physical exfoliant there is Its non scented and built from a product that naturally softens in water so its gentle on your skin I find other physical exfoliants use products like walnut shells and coffee groundings  which do not grind to the same sizes AND do not break down with water This can be very dangerous when your just scrubbing your face with it and if your anyone like me you go to town with exfoliants This rice powder is gentle safe and gets the job done Its well worth the price point because since it comes as a powder it lasts longer than you think as you use so little compared to a gel physical exfoliant My favorite tatcha product\\nread more Beautiful product My skin has never been so soft Pores appear smaller  My skin feels so soft after using this i was afraid it would be too harsh as it seemed to be a kind of physical exfoliator as well as enzyme but the rice particles are really so tiny that you dont feel it once it foams I chose this as a free sample last time I ordered from Sephora because I had heard and read rave reviews I have very sensitive and acne prone skin so I have trouble finding effective exfoliants which are gentle enough for my skin This did not disappoint I liked it so much I ordered it immediately I like how you can control the grittiness depending on how much water you use Ive also mixed it with my Avene cleanser Expensive but a little goes a long way Updated On February 12 2020 I have now used this twice a day with my regular Avene cleanser for almost 3 weeks My skin is super clear and soft I really think this is worth the price tag\\nread more Love this Have been using it for almost a month and its helped my pores look smaller and my skin looks great I love how soft this makes my face feel It doesnt at all feel too harsh to use daily and leaves a wonderful ricey scent during my morning ritual I have only been using this product for three days and OMG My face was instantly exfoliated brighten and even toned My husband commented on how bright and clean my face looked today I just freaken love this I have tried many other exfoliates and laura mercier gommage was my go too not favorite but better than most This is heaven I love it I am so glad I found you rice polish I first tried this product during an oxygenating facial at Sephora I would never have thought to buy a just add water to this powder type of exfoliant but it is excellent I bought the Classic immediately and love it Have been using this for a while and I love this product It gently exfoliates my face and leaves it so smooth A little goes a long way so its worth its price point in my opinion I have sensitive skin that reacts to practically everything I love this cleanser Its very gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean without drying it out Its pricy but you need so little that its actually pretty decent value for money Even if I use a dimesized amount daily its going to last months Instantly my skin was smooth I tried a sample of this I will be purchasing this ASAP Amazing 1010 My skin has never felt so soft and clean and the smell is lovely I will repurchase this until the end of time I have very sensitive skin Im usually dry but sometimes get oily in my Tzone This got rid of all the roughuneven texture on my skin and my skin looks so smooth now The type deep is a very gentle Gives a deep exfoliation leaving skin smooth without irritation even for my sensitive skin I have dry and acneprone skin and have been using the light blue one targeted for acne skin for at least 6 months now I was a bit apprehensive at first due to the PH level issues people have written about but I make sure not to use this for more than 15 seconds and have been fine It has done an excellent job gently exfoliating my skin I use it 3x a week in my evening routine to help with my evening skincare product absorption Ive noticed an improvement in overall texture and brightness No more physical defoliators for me\\nread more Im always skeptical of expensive skin care but this has totally changed my skin and it lasts forever Ive been using it for about a year now and its one of the few products that once I incorporated into my skin care I sw a noticeable difference in brighter smoother skin I use a small amount daily just in the morning and its last a year I chatted with someone about if it expires but was told because it is a dry product it shouldnt go bad and I havent noticed any change in quality Because of how long it lasts and the noticeable results it was definitely worth the cost for me I was worried it would be too intense other types of exfoliates have irritated my skin but this is so gentle Ive had no issues\\nread more Im not sure what kind of sorcery this is but Ive just used it once and my skin has never felt SO smooth and healthy It doesnt even feel like its exfoliating or anything It feels much like a cream wash or a foaming wash Im honestly shook Amazing is incredible how soft leave this product your skin I have very dry skin so I bought the oil cleanse and this one I uses the oil on my dry face to remove the makeup and then this rice polish for a deep cleaning Incredible best cleanse Ive ever used Baby skin for ever with this after just a few uses I noticed a significant improvement in my skin my blackheads literally vanished It keeps my skin feeling and looking fresh Im pretty much addicted to tatcha products This one quickly became a staple My skin is typically dry sensitive and eczema prone I pretty much use her whole line now but this exfoliater powder I use twice a day It took all my acne pigmentation right away without actually peeling my skin and going through a stage of flaky skin My next jar will be the new indigo line catered to sensitive skin to try it out This is my holy grail face wash I use it every single day twice a day and it leaves my face feeling so smooth every single wash In the mornings when I dont want as much exfoliating power I rub it between my palms for longer than usual which creates a nice gentle lather I forgot this at home when I went to Mexico for a vacation and noticed a distinct difference in my skin texture for the worse without it I have acne prone skin and it never has broken me out I got my mom addicted to this as well Its so so good\\nread more Best physical exfoliant there is Its non scented and built from a product that naturally softens in water so its gentle on your skin I find other physical exfoliants use products like walnut shells and coffee groundings  which do not grind to the same sizes AND do not break down with water This can be very dangerous when your just scrubbing your face with it and if your anyone like me you go to town with exfoliants This rice powder is gentle safe and gets the job done Its well worth the price point because since it comes as a powder it lasts longer than you think as you use so little compared to a gel physical exfoliant My favorite tatcha product\\nread more Beautiful product My skin has never been so soft Pores appear smaller  My skin feels so soft after using this i was afraid it would be too harsh as it seemed to be a kind of physical exfoliator as well as enzyme but the rice particles are really so tiny that you dont feel it once it foams I chose this as a free sample last time I ordered from Sephora because I had heard and read rave reviews I have very sensitive and acne prone skin so I have trouble finding effective exfoliants which are gentle enough for my skin This did not disappoint I liked it so much I ordered it immediately I like how you can control the grittiness depending on how much water you use Ive also mixed it with my Avene cleanser Expensive but a little goes a long way Updated On February 12 2020 I have now used this twice a day with my regular Avene cleanser for almost 3 weeks My skin is super clear and soft I really think this is worth the price tag\\nread more Love this Have been using it for almost a month and its helped my pores look smaller and my skin looks great I love how soft this makes my face feel It doesnt at all feel too harsh to use daily and leaves a wonderful ricey scent during my morning ritual I have only been using this product for three days and OMG My face was instantly exfoliated brighten and even toned My husband commented on how bright and clean my face looked today I just freaken love this I have tried many other exfoliates and laura mercier gommage was my go too not favorite but better than most This is heaven I love it I am so glad I found you rice polish I first tried this product during an oxygenating facial at Sephora I would never have thought to buy a just add water to this powder type of exfoliant but it is excellent I bought the Classic immediately and love it Have been using this for a while and I love this product It gently exfoliates my face and leaves it so smooth A little goes a long way so its worth its price point in my opinion I have sensitive skin

every penny this is the most hydrating toner ive ever used I have combination to oily skin and this works really well for my skin Its hydrating enough without being oily im on my second bottle now

a back out one brought so I will never run out I LIVE for this product LIVE My skin is super moisturized and glowy from this nondrying toner My one criticism is that the rose petals get stuck in the

lasts months i use everyday with a cotton pad  it is so so so amazing cant say enough good things This product is really good I just finished my third bottle and I have to say its better than any

the nozzle when youre trying to apply it to a cotton round Life changing product I honestly dont write reviews and this is my first one because it truly deserves recognition I cant express enough how much this produce changed my skin I have severely dry skin but I also break out and have redness and this product addressed all those concerns in a matter of days My skin hasnt looked this good in so

many products to fight my acne I was super skeptical about this one since didnt think toner could do much But decided to give it a try after reading all the positive reviews I was shocked After first use it healed my skin and blemishes looks so much brighter Im in love with this product I am amazed by this product I was hesitant at first as this product has salicylic acid in it and wondering if using it once daily would dry out my skin Ive been using this product for almost a month and Ive had nothing but great results I wouldnt consider myself to have oily skin Im more combination skin but the ingredients salicylic acid and glycolic acid are great for sloughing off dead skin cells and removing dirt and excess sebum While I wasnt miracles as Ive dealt with somewhat cystic acne for years it has really improved my skin by shrinking my pores like it says it does providing that extra deep clean without damaging the skin and seems to be speeding up the healing process of previous blemishespimples I also followup with a glycolic acid night cream When using glycolic acid products sunscreen is a must since glycolic acid acts in the same way as a facial scrub or mild facial peel I also really love the tingling feeling after applying it as it gives me a deep clean feeling without being too stripping of natural oils Bonus is that its under Sephoras Clean Beauty products Love that too As you can tell I am loving this product and its been a game changer for me Ive been quite satisfied using other Olehenriksen products as well and this experience definitely gives me more

but empty out my wallet If you have oily problem skin please try this Not every product is for everyone but this is worth the shot if the end result is like mine\\nread more after trying so many products to fight my acne I was super skeptical about this one since didnt think toner could do much But decided to give it a try after reading all the positive reviews I was shocked After first use it healed my skin and blemishes looks so much brighter Im in love with this product I am amazed by this product I was hesitant at first as this product has salicylic acid in it and wondering if using it once daily would dry out my skin Ive been using this product for almost a month and Ive had nothing but great results I wouldnt consider myself to have oily skin Im more combination skin but the ingredients salicylic acid and glycolic acid are great for sloughing off dead skin cells and removing dirt and excess sebum While I wasnt miracles as Ive dealt with somewhat cystic acne for years it has really improved my skin by shrinking my pores like it says it does providing that extra deep clean without damaging the skin and seems to be speeding up the healing process of previous blemishespimples I also followup with a glycolic acid night cream When using glycolic acid products sunscreen is a must since glycolic acid acts in the same way as a facial scrub or mild facial peel I also really love the tingling feeling after applying it as it gives me a deep clean feeling without being too stripping of natural oils Bonus is that its under Sephoras Clean Beauty products Love that too As you can tell I am loving this product and its been a game changer for me Ive been quite satisfied using other Olehenriksen products as well and this experience definitely gives me more confidence in trying out other products from this line\\nread more I absolutely love this toner I had difficulty finding a toner that doesnt feel like Im stripping my face but also gives me that clean

glad I finally found something that works for me I love it is a must have product I use for my skin care and also when I do my makeup Sometimes my face look dry because the setting powder etc and I just spray and my face look really smooth and sometimes I dont even need a setting spray because this product does the job I just dont like the smell Fresh Fresh Im a bit of a collector of face sprays

this stuff so very much I spray it on under my makeup over my makeup throughout the day Often I use it very often It is so refreshing and the perfect spritz to start the day Did I mention that I love it This is my fourth bottle and I am never going to stop repurchasing Love love love this product So refreshing and perfect for a pick me up And it definitely has reduced my pore size and brightened my complexion Caudalie never fails to make amazing products I purchased the Caudalie Favorites set and started using this as a means to possibly add more moisture to my skin post makeup During the winter my skin has a tendency to feel super tight and then in a few hours look super oily with sliding makeup I sprayed this on with few expectations and noticed that my pores looked smaller throughout the day there seemed to be less oil excretion my makeup was staying put and my skin felt comfortable to wear An added bonus is this is refreshing and smells so good I also love the packaging A huge pet peeve is when I put bottles in my bag and the top comes off  especially when the bottles are spray bottles The top stays on so well and is a pleasure for travel use\\nread more Ive been using this for over 10 years A few times Ive balked at the price and havent reordered figuring how much is this really doing Well a lot My skin feels and noticeably looks better calm less red and irriitated more refreshed So I begrudgingly end up reordering and am so happy when it arrives The rest of my skin care routine applies better as well use both day i love it feels it soo freshed i use it under make up to hydrate my skin and works great On my third bottle At first I did not know what the fuss was about but when Id run out nothing else Id use was as good I use it in the morning before putting on my makeup I use a more moisturizing spray at night before deep moisture I have dry skin Very moisturizing and refreshing Doesnt feel more dry like other moisture sprays once it dries Nice as a midday pick me up I leave it on my desk at work and spray when I need a bit of moisture After being introduced to a soothing mist that my esthetic nurse friend gave me a sample of I wrestled within myself on whether or not I should incorporate something like that in my skincare routine Also I remember years ago that an esthetician I knew years ago would use one of Dermalogicas additives I think it was the Clearing Additive in my treatments and I loved it Before using the soothing mist I wouldnt even give any consideration about buying something like this as I would have deemed it as unnecessary Also the Dermalogica Additive provided one of the best experiences Ive had during a facial other than the pops of course So after using mostly fragrancefree or noadded fragrance products in my skincare routine as well as my husband complaining that some of the products did have an aversive scent I dont blame him as I felt the same way I found myself missing that sensory element of smelling spalike aromas Also I consider my skincare routine to be a slice of time that I have for myself Ultimately I bought a bottle of this stuff as it turned out to be gentle on my skin I made sure to test it out first by spritzing it each time I went to a Sephora which is great because it does list parfum as part of its ingredients Also the sprayer produces very fine mists that feels like a true moisture boost kind of like a light humidifier feeling as opposed to a feeling like small drops landed on my skin  falling down on my face like tears I dont find myself fanning my face after using this The elements of a great spray mechanism soothing to my face  the spalike sensory experience are the top reasons why I decided to buy this The fact that it can be easily purchased at popular

toner and eye makeup remover Expensive but worth it I used to purchase the drugstore facial cotton but I decided to try these a couple of years ago no regrets I find that I use less because they absorb more liquid which the environment thanks me for I only repurchase about once a year I like them best for applying my toner and removing my eye makeup They are so soft my skin is pretty sensitive and these have made a huge difference Make sure that you store them in a dry place because they can absorb moisture in the air I store mine in a cabinet outside of my bathroom\\nread more I have repurchased this over and over They are soft and gentle when removing my eye makeup at the end of the night I literally never thought these would be different enough to warrant the 10x markup

luxury and 100 worth it Ill never do without these again I love these They dont shed on my face or break a park The are very soft and dont tug on my skin So easy to use and so soft Wish it would sell

cottons have always been too rough on my skin so when I saw these I knew I had to try them out They are so soft and I have been using them for about 2 years now 12 for some facial cottons might seem expensive but if you have sensitive skin like mine these are AMAZING Highly reccomend These are great Theyre soft  they dont fall apart when you use them Theyre gentle on your skin I use it with my

the best Worth every penny if you have delicate or sensitive skin My favorite cotton pads So soft and thick Works great for toner and eye makeup remover Expensive but worth it I used to purchase the drugstore facial cotton but I decided to try these a couple of years ago no regrets I find that I use less because they absorb more liquid which the environment thanks me for I only repurchase about once a year I like them best for applying my toner and removing my eye makeup They are so soft my skin is pretty sensitive and these have made a huge difference Make sure that you store them in a dry place because they can absorb moisture in the air I store mine in a cabinet outside of my bathroom\\nread more I have repurchased this over and over They are soft and gentle when removing my eye

everything about this cleanser the feel the smell and the results I have been using this product every day for the past couple of months and my skin feels smooth soft and clear Great for soothing red and irritated skin My daughter loves this product She has very red cheeks and this products calms the redness I have never bought a moisturizer from Sephora I only use Cetaphil oil control moisturizer for many years Im hooked on the Aqua Bomb Absolutely love the dewy finish A little goes a long way I absolutely love the belif  I use it everyday along with the face wash and toner Im beyond obsessed with this skin care line  This stuff is magic I have this to thank for no wrinkles at 40 love this brand everything is amazing the aqua bomb has the right amount of moisturizer without being too heavy important in az my skin loves it This is the most refreshing hydrating product I have ever tried This moisturizer makes my face feel so amazing I feel like it helped my acne a little as well This is my new favorite moisturizer I have dry to combination skin and this is the perfect combination for both It feels like water when I put it on but does a great job moisturizing The scent is light Ive been on accutane for 2 months now this is seriously the best moisturizer Ive tried If youve heard of accutane or been on it you know how extremely drying it is My skin was starting to flake off and this stuff basically saved me It also made my skin extremely sensitive but Ive had no adverse reaction to this This moisturizer is excellent for oilycombination skin I am oily on my tzone and dry along my jawline and this cream isnt so light that it cant handle both I wouldnt call it super lightweight but its also not heavy either its somewhere in the middle It absorbs quickly so no worrying about it setting before foundation Ive been using it for 2 years now and every time I try another moisturizer I come back to this one A must buy for combination skin\\nread more I have always struggled with dry damaged skin and since i started using thai product my skin is always so smooth and moisturized If you have been looking for good moisturizer i would definitely recommend this product i will definitely forever use this product I love this stuff Honestly works good and smells good Doesnt leave sticky residue on face Recommend  Have been using this for about 67 months and I can say I love it I have tried other products but continue to go back to this Only use it in the mornings along with the rest of my products and I love it I literally cant live without it You wont regret buying this Absolutely in love with this cream it is perfect for my combination skin My skin looks beautiful and shiny since I use it it has helped me make my makeup look much better and my skin smoother This wasnt hydrating enough until about 6 months ago when I noticed my skin getting oily and now its a holy grail day cream A little goes a long way it sinks in quickly and wears beautifully under makeup If I do have any dry patches Ill top this with a bit of marula oil on those areas only it never pills up and Ive actually noticed my makeup lasts longer I wish it came in an airless pump but I bought one from Amazon and I find it helps me use less I get about 3 months out of the 16 oz tub Ive used the Belif Moisture Bomb at night and the Eye Bomb day and night for years and the entire line is fantastic I definitely recommend this for those with oily and combo skin although normal skin types may also like it\\nread more My skin loves the moisturizing soft cream This was a favorite in my 20s and 30s and in my 40s its perfect Its light weight and absorbs quickly I like to layer or mix it with the Renewal Oil for extra moisture Its lovely under the the SPF 50 UV Protecting Fluid and makeup during the day and over heavier serums at night I love the fragrance Its expensive but a little goes a long way I am 35 and have combo skin that has become less oily in my Tzone and more parched on my cheeks I am surprised to say this works with a caveat It works exceptionally well at improving the appearance of a scar that I have on my forehead as well as significantly diminishing the wrinkles on my forehead Like other reviewers when I first started wearing this it dried quickly and I felt that it wasnt moisturizing enough However I kept using it and would sometimes add another more occlusive moisturizer on top  I prefer heavier moisturizers I am in week 3 of using it and hate that I like it so much If you like heavy moisturizers FAB DE Protini Belief Moisture Bomb then this will take some getting used to Also I think the differences in reviews might stem from the skin you start with I dont see this cream doing wonders for my cheeks I dont have any problems there  in fact I need more moisture there but I see it doing wonders for my forehead where I have wrinkles a scar and had teenage acne\\nread more I have combination skin so in the winter it gets very dry This moisturizer quenches any dry skin and gives a beautiful radiance I tend to break out easily but Ive had no flareups with this I read some reviews that said the smell wasnt great but I actually really like it My skin looks healthy and refreshed with this moisturizer I am in LOVE with this product Ive had my eye on this for years but never took the plunge because of the hefty price and reviews Many people like to compare this to the Nivea Creme and I just assumed they were correct However the ingredients are much different and OMG I saw results after the first day My skin hasnt looked this great in years This will forever be a staple in my daily routine LOVE Got it in the Sephora collections package for Christmas and it makes my skin glow I am not a huge fan of the smell but my skin is so soft from it Ive been using it AM  PM I dont want to love this moisturizer because of the price tag but I always end up coming back I have red sensitive skin and after using this at night my skin looks so calmed and less inflamed Ive taken a break from using this for a month or longer and then after just one application the results are obvious Its moisturizing without being greasy or leaving a residue Good moisture for sensitive skin Any time if my skin has an issue I will go for this one OMG My 60 year old skin has never been this hydrated Fine lines are gone I love this product I was resistant to purchasing because it it pricey but I found I purchased far fewer products to get the results I receive from using this exquisite moisturizer I have purchased both versions of this cream and both are excellent I really love this moisturizer The first week I tried it I was concerned because I broke out I have very sensitive skin but after that my skin cleared up and was very glowy and moisturizedworth the price point if you are debating itI have combination skin and this product got me threw the winter months I really love this cream I have nothing negative to say about it as it is keeping my skin looking happy healthy and plump I am 30 now and want to take the best care that I can and this cream definitely helps I do not use a lot and a 15ml jar lasts me 34 months I also mix it with Juno oil and that helps me use less as well It is pricey but I try to buy when Sephora has 20 off so that helps La Mer has a strong celebrity following for a reason  it works I dont get all the negative reviews from people who received free samples The soft cream is a staple in my skincare routine Ive used this for many years and it keeps my skin hydrated with very few visible wrinkles despite my age My skin is sensitive to almost every moisturizer out there but La Mer soft cream never breaks me out Sometimes triedandtrue simpler products are better La Mer is great and they dont need neon packaging or fake reviews to sell their stellar products\\nread more worth every penny keeps skin hydrated and really fresh looking I gave it a 5star because it delivers what it promises Other than that there is no WOW factors that those current skincare offers If you want a luxurious cream without any skin irritations this is for you I personally look for antiaging products with highlight ingredients so I found this product is mediocre to my taste I like it afterall but will not repurchase I have combination skin and this stuff works like magic On nights when I want a little more moisture I mix in a couple of drops of facial oil Have already repurchased twice now It make my skin so soft and keep effect pretty long I use it as a face cream and it makes your skin unbelifably smooth lol This moisturizer is a must have  Its keeps my skin soft and supple all day without a greasy feel It smells so nice and my skin drinks it right up This product is a life saver in this dry California air It does an amazing job of moisturizing without clogging pores and leaves skin feeling light and refreshed all day This is my absolute favorite moisturizer I was hesitant at first because I have such sensitive acne prone skin but it doesnt break me out at all 1010 worth the price and its something I can never stop buying AMAZING I originally received this as a sample and started using it after i ran out of my Tatcha moisturizer Very light weight and soothing to the skin I have sensitive skin and it didnt break out after using it Sample it and if you love it the bigger jar is the better value A little goes a long way This product provides the exact amount of moisture I need especially during dry weather and winter It never irritates my skin and goes on like butter  soaks right in but still feels cushy and hydrating It also works great layering with other products  skin oils serums etc This is a new staple on my shelf This product is amazing Not greasy sinks into the skin really fast but you dont have to keep on applying to feel moisturized Its incredible One of the best moisturizers on the market Gentle insanely hydrating in a nongreasy way leaves my skin so supple and firm and smells like HEAVEN I look forward to putting this on before bed it instantly relaxes me AMAZING THE BEST CREAM I HAVE TESTED IN MY LIFE MY SKIN HAS CHANGED IT IS REALLY THE BEST INVESTMENT A clean gentle moisturizer I like to apply at night It can also be used in the day time but does not contain spf so be sure to supplement with sun protection I love this moisturizer I have extremely dry skin and havent been able to find a cream that hydrates doesnt break me out and isnt greasyuntil now This cream is also great under makeup as a primer I got a sample of this as part of the Sephora rewards and will be buying the full size This moisturizer is so good It hydrates my skin so well without leaving it greasy or tacky at all My skin is soft with no breakouts Ive used this for over a year now a little goes a long way for me A little thicker and more moisturizing than the gel formula so its great for dry skin Been using this moisturizer for years I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and the ingredients in this product are very safe and have not given me any concerns Also this product Really helps my skin stay balanced I live in Florida so lots of got to air conditioned spaces and having a good moisturizer is critical This product easily applies over serums and goes very well under spf I buy tons of this stuff every year Highly recommend to anyone with combo skin but even dry skin\\nread more Ive never found something that helps my dry and flakey skin to the extent that this does My parents got me a thing of samples of all different products for Christmas and this was my favorite My skin wasnt flakey it didnt feel dry and tight anymore Ok I literally never review products but had to for this I have perpetually dry skin and nothing seems to moisturize my face without it drying out by end of day But this product leaves my face soft and hydrated all day I use it along with the belif aqua jelly cleanser Love both I got a sample of this and Im shocked at how well this worked Normally I use moisturizer samples as quick rescue at work in these dry winter days but most samples dont wow me to buy the actual product this one converted me This is my everyday face makeup It provides enough sheer coverage for me without looking heavy or caked on at all My goto Has a silky coverage and is not cakey at all Makes my blemishes and pores less noticeable but doesnt feel like I have make up on at all And its SFP 30 I have extremely temperamental sensitive unpredictable skin I can truly say that this is the only cosmetic face productfoundation that I can confidently apply without worrying about it causing weird flaking dryness redness not rubbing in properly etc This is the only foundationtype product I can apply with my fingers in 30 seconds when Im running late and I know it will still look great Its so low maintenance and always look nice Please please never stop making this product It is the only thing that works for my sensitive skin and my busy lifestyle\\nread more Im 45 and Ive NEVER liked the feel of foundation Ive only purchased a few in my time but have always opted for tinted moisturizers instead I came across this a couple of years ago and have been very happy Tried another brand recently just cuz and it was a good comparisonand testimony as to how good THIS tinted moisturizer is Im actually not a huge advocate for sunscreen on a daily basis bc we need Vitamin D And the little bit of sun I get going about my daily business isnt enough to warrant sunscreen IMO I also have a lot of melanin in my skin so Im fortunate there less risk of skin cancer That being said I LOVE that this SPF is mineral based The typical chemical based sunscreens are hormone and endocrine disruptors My life has changed since I started removing all of the chemical junk from my skin and body care My periods are more regulated with less cramping bareMinerals does a really great job at keeping their products clean I just switched to their blush bc of this and am super happy with it as well The coverage is great with this while still providing moisture and movement in the skin And I love that the colors blend so well Im a 6 Ginger in winter and a 95 Terra in the summer In spring and summer as my skin transitions color I mix the two Overall IMO this is the best there is It offers everything you could possibly need\\nread more Great for daily wear provides enough coverage for the natural look still makes you look put together I have been using this product for as long as I can remember and I dont think I will switch anytime soon to a different tinted moisturizer It gives a very natural finish that makes my skin look even while also looking like skin I highly recommend if you are looking for a good tinted moisturizer that gets the job done Love it I received a sample of this and on a whim decided to try it on morning I fell in love Perfect not too much coverage for those days I dont want full coverage while still hiding pesky imperfections Just ordered my second tube A MUA friend of mine recommended this product to me and I am so glad she did I tend to not want to wear make up unless I have to But then I look like death This product allows me to have just a bit of coverage and color but still feels so light This is by far my favorite cosmetic product that Ive ever used and Ive used many over the years Ive been complimented so many times and asked what I have on my face Even on days I dont want to wear makeup I still always at least apply this It evens out my skin adds a touch of glow and looks very natural My 3 daughters my sister friends and motherinlaw all use it now too I also love that it has SPF 30 in it\\nread more This is my goto everyday product When not using foundation this is what I use and it provides just enough coverage but is also very light on my skin I really like using it during the summer especially since it has SPF Just love this stuff for those days I dont want or need foundation Evens out the skin tone and blends flawlessly into my skin Hydration and sunscreen and it doesnt make me break out Just a fabulous productnote I went into the sephora store to make sure I was getting a perfect color match It feels as though Ive searched forever for a foundation that provided just the right amount of coverage to even out my skin tone but still looks natural I have freckles and if I cant see them full coverage foundation I dont feel like myself This provides everything I wanted  good color SPF just the right coverage and extra moisturizing for my dry skin I regularly purchase this product It is so light in texture that it looks like you are not wearing make up It does a great job covering blemishes on your skin that are not dark I absolutely love this stuff I have super dry skin and Im on acutane This is the only makeup I can put on without my skin instantly drying up again A little goes a long way and its super light on the skin This has been my goto tinted moisturizer for every day use for almost two years now When I say every day I dont mean for work I mean running errands grabbing lunch wanting to look a little more put together For work going to dinner ect I like a fresh satindewy medium coverage foundation Sinks into my skin beautifully not bringing attention to texture or dry patches You cannot tell I have anything on my face while it evens out any discoloration or blemishes Sometimes I will tap a little concealer to blemishes and my under eyes but you dont necessarily need it I literally will rub it with my finger tips and it looks so natural Highly recommend\\nread more Love this product so much Ive probably gone through about 6 tubes of this stuff but it truly is my perfect everyday base It lightly evens out the skin tone so it would look great by itself on a nomakeup makeup day but also plays well with most concealers to amp up the coverage It always gives my skin the most beautiful luminous glow and I really cant imagine using another everyday base product I love this product so much Have been using it for a few years and my skin has always had the right amount of moisture since Ive used it I apply this first thing every morning and then apply Bare Minerals foundation over it Its the best tinted moisturizer Ive ever used Actually this is only one that doesnt contain silicones and other comedogenic ingredients Thats why I love it so much It doesnt cause new breakouts and the same time hydrate the skin But Im very sad that Birch 15 is out of stock Please bring back Birch  I had originally purchased another dry skin moisturizer that didnt work out so I decided to grab this one instead I am super happy with how soft and moisturized this makes me feel Its still winter here and this soaks right in leaving no dry patches I feel like its also light enough to wear in the warmer months because my skin drinks it up It has a light fragrance but it doesnt irritate my skin and the smell disappears after a short time Highly recommend trying this\\nread more been shopping at sephora for years now and tbh this is the thing that i find most worth it left my EXTREMELY SOFT hydrated without it feeling heavy and smoooooooth A Sephora rep recommended this for me as I wanted something to put on before foundation and while I love Charlotte tilbury its expensive This was cheaper and you get a lot more product I love it it soaks in quick and doesnt bother patchiness etc the foundation My goal for 2020 was to take better care of my skin and luckily I got this on Christmas Eve Ive used it every day along with the dream cream and eye cream and my skin has never felt softer or looked better I put this on every morning or when I get out of the shower and I love it The smell is amazing and it doesnt make my face break out or feel greasy I will use this for a long time to come Ive never really liked using a moisturizer in the morning but I actually really liked using this one I like that it doesnt leave my face feeling super oily just feeling moisturized and hydrated It leaves my skin feeling so soft It has such an incredible scent fresh but not overpowering and I love that Im a bit sensitive when it comes to scents which is why I usually shy away from scented things but this smells amazing and I will for sure keep using\\nread more I received this moisturizer for free for review Ive used this a couple times but noticed it doesnt work as well for me as the night cream It did soak in easy and didnt make me feel like I was WEARING moisturizer like others I have tried It didnt leave my skin greasy Just moisture The scent is lotus which is kinda cucumber I dont mind the scent but I could see why others dont This product was lightweight in beautiful packaging which reflects the price I would recommend this product\\nread more Years ago when working retail I purchased a few things from Fresh I wasnt super enthused with the products and didnt give the brand another chance So when I got the news that I was receiving a vox box full of Fresh products while grateful I didnt expect them to be amazing Boy was I wrong my socks have been blown off bye how intuitive this skincare is Ive incorporated 3 of the Lotus Youth Preserve products into my skincare routine and am floored with the results One of the most surprising anecdotes is my combo skin didnt react negatively to any of the productsAT ALL I usually have at least a few days of skin grumpiness when I try new products but all 3 worked perfectly for my sensitive skin I do still get blemishes once in awhile due to me forgetting to wash my pillowcase as frequent as I should When that happens I start putting a vitamin c concentrate underneath the Lotus Dream Cream and it sorts it right out  My skin feels more moisturized suppleplump calmed and a bit more radiant Everything in the lotus line has a cucumbery relaxing scent The consistency of the Lotus YP Moisturizer daytime cream feels a bit gelatinous like a hydrating cucumber maskbut it absorbs wonderfully into the skin and doesnt leave a weird residue The day cream keeps my skin wellhydrated throughout the day without getting greasy under makeup Ive noticed a little dab goes a long way I also admire the prettiness of the Lotus line packagingdesign and how durablethick the containers are This is ideal for a clumsy gal like myself  And thank you Fresh for making the night cream container a different color from the day and eye cream containers Its way easier to not mix them up when my glasses are off for the day Highly recommend you grab yourself all 3 Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve products as they seem to work symbiotically together\\nread more I have oily skin and this product hydrates my skin without making it more oily Lasts a long time too as you dont need to use much each time Just smiling in a photo with my new bae I mean my new facial moisturizer Lol its so delightful The hints of cucumber that are released when you apply it to your face is my absolute favorite Its giving me happy spa vibes I added this on top of the Fresh Lotus eye cream Layering the same products w the same scent is genius Its wild how many companies make so many dif scents that do not compliment other products If you enjoy feeling like youre walking on sunshine buy thisss \\nread more This entire line smells like heaven I love that it has anti aging properties and i really see a difference in my under eye area after using it nightly for a few weeks Let me begin by saying that I LOVE THESE PRODUCTS  After purchasing yellow facial moisturizer in a square bottle from department stores since I was a teenager and occasionally trying highend products from drug stores I was skeptical about trying yet another face moisturizer but am wowed with the results of these 3 products  The Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer has a light pleasant scent and goes on smoothly keeping my face looking clean and fresh throughout the day  It is not greasy or heavy but makes a big impact on my skin  Ive received several compliments about how good my skin looks since I started using these products 2 months ago  I feel the difference and see it every time I look in the mirror my skin is smoother and the wrinkles are less prominent  I cant believe the difference  The Lotus Youth Preserve Eye Cream also has super moisturizing powers but isnt too heavy and enables a smooth application of concealer  I also enjoy the Lotus Youth Preserve Dream Face Cream and the combination of using these 3 products daily has rejuvenated my facial skin and gives me a younger appearance and at 61 years old I never thought this was possible  These products are now part of my daily routine and they have a permanent place on my bathroom counter I received these as a free sample\\nread more This is my FAVORITE moisturizer of all time Ive tried ones way more expensive and I always go back to this one it

skin and I could not find anything that helped my dry flaky patches on my forehead and cheeks I was so self conscious about it and I couldnt even wear makeup because it looked so bad I noticed a difference with this moisturizer immediately and love that even though its thick it sinks into your skin so effortlessly When I ran out last week I started using a different one until I could restock and within a day my skin was back to its old ways and was soo angry If you have struggled to find anything to help with your dry skin buy this and you wont regret it\\nread more My favorite moisturizer So gentle and so hydrating I thought I would give CereVe moisturizer for a try since I like the face wash and didnt have the money for this one and I missed this product so much This is a fantastic product and is a fair price I recently moved to a drier climate that has very cold and harsh wind Quickly my skin was suffering when the winter came around I ran out my previous moisturizer and came out of the store with this one Ive been using it for about a month day and night Ive seen tremendous improvements in the texture of my skin I am usually acne prone with red scarring mostly hormonal and stress induced along with horrible dry patches on my cheeks and nose My skin is now very smooth and soft because of this moisturizer It does not clog my pores or cause breakouts and is very soothing I also use it on my hands and occasionally my legs\\nread more This is another one of my favorites like I said it makes my face feel so good and the price is so reasonable very good product Adore this moisturizer Its affordable and it works better than most products Ive tried on my skin It helped with dryness and actually brightened my skin Love it I love this cream so much  I actually only found out today that this was intended for your face I got a sample several years ago and have been buying it since as I found that nothing would do as well as this on my extremely dry hands In the winter my skin dries out so badly and the skin on my fingertips cracks open I use it on both myself and my kids and it heals and prevents the wintery itching and cracking If you dont want the side effects of steroid creams or hydrocortisone this is a great option\\nread more This product is amazing It so moisturizing but not greasy or heavy at all I found this a few years ago and havent looked back I initially used it solely on my face when I was dealing with some pretty bad dryness Now I use it all over It drys down fairly quickly and leaves my skin soft and hydrated I have atopic dermatitis in almost my entire body including my legs arms and between legs I have used prescription products and medicines by my dermatologist and this specific product is the one that has taken me out of the worst with the condition I love it I hope it never sold out or not exist anymore This winter my skin has been dryer than usual and let me tell you this sAVED MY SKIN Being acne prone I was nervous but this hasnt broken my skin out at all I would highly recommend it it also never burns dry skin like other creams I love this It works for my normal to oily skin very well Does

product I havent looked back No crazy breakouts very smooth transition to my morning routine I have acne prone skin Very acne prone skin Most of it is hormonal  but Ive been struggling with it for years I also have pretty combination skin Im not always very dry but Im not always oily either During the winter months my skin flakes underneath my makeup like crazy My skin will feel moisturized and I put my makeup on and suddenly my skin is flaming everywhere and looks disgusting This moisturizer changed the game I wont use anything else now I feel so sorry for those who said it makes them break out because Ive had nothing but a great experience with this moisturizer I think thats a true testament to say that everyone reacts differently to things Even after using a cleanser one day that was too much for my skin this moisturizer soothed my skin like no other I cant believe I didnt hear about this earlier I always thought using heavy moisturizers was the key to curing dry skin if you use a little bit this feels light AND moisturizes your skin like no other Will never use another product\\nread more I absolutely love this product I got this as a replacement for my DE FBalm Which I started using for eczema and it works but it was too expensive to use to much every day Now Im using this on nearly my whole body every night and my hot spots every day I love the feel of it the subtle normal lotion smell and I am definitely going to get the tube next time My ultimate HOLY GRAIL moisturizer I have very dry skin and this helps a lot to stop sensitivity on my face when my skin is dry and itchy Im obsessed w this formula and is my Holy Grail face cream I use it with The Ordinarys hyaluronic acid 2 serum and find I get the best results out of it  I have softest and plumpest skin throughout the day Its a bit tacky after application but it dries down to a soft touch Will continue to buy this time and time again this is the best I got it in my play subscription box and I love it it works so well and its super heavy thank you So I wont lie I do not gravitate toward Clinique because it always reminded me a more mature skincaremakeup line I received a sample with a Sephora purchase and was instantly obsessed Moisturized without leaving your skin greasy My face looked hydrated and plum ALL DAMN DAY Great for under makeup Ran out and bought the full size I guess Clinique has been around forever because its tried and true\\nread more I have sensitive skin that is normal to dry or oily depending on the season I like this hydrator because it makes my skin feel nourished and plump I didnt get any irritation or buildup or cakiness from this formula and I love wearing it alone or using it before applying makeup Just dont use too much as it may feel heavy and greasy if you do that Otherwise I like it Hydrates my skin very well My skin feels soft smooth and supple This helps make my foundation look smooth and flawless I am 40 have sensitive acneprone oily skin Ive been almost happy with PTRs hyaluronic acid cloud cream and Kiehls ultra oil free moisturizing but they both left my skin feeling dehydrated a couple hours later during the winter I decided to try this and was pleasantly surprised No breakouts or irritation and my skin feels hydrated all day long Ill have to see how this works for me during the summer but Im hopeful it wont leave me feeling too oily It also works well under my liquid foundation which I rarely wear or under powder sunscreen my daily sunscreen My only disappointment with this product is the container Although I always have clean hands when using I would prefer a pump to minimize introduction of contaminants Just FYI aside from the largest size which is the cheapest per ml the 17 oz50ml is the cheapest per ml I guess they assume most people wont calculate it\\nread more I have extremely sensitive skin which is why I wanted a face moisturizer for my dry acne prone skin that will moisturize my skin without

product\\nread more I have pretty dry skin and this is the moisturizer Ive found that helps the most without being crazy expensive A little goes a long way and it absorbs super quickly It alleviates that tight feeling I get if I dont moisturize my skin constantly and it makes my skin feel great for a full day or so I use it at night before bed but if Im not wearing makeup Ill use it in the mornings at home It makes my skin feel soft and dewy without being too wet if that makes sense The only reason I dont use it under makeup is because I use a SPF moisturizer if Im going out thus am putting makeup on I even use it on my eyes and it doesnt irritate them at all so I no longer use a separate moisturizer for my eyes even better\\nread more I posted the following review BY MISTAKE on Clinique  moisture surge intense skin fortifying hydrater  which I returned Dont even bother with other moisturizing gels Ive tried so many and keep coming back to this Its non irritating to my eyes

back This product helped balance and moisturize my dehydrated skin without ever leaving an oily residue My skin feels hydrated and happy all day long and never greasy even under makeup This product has almost a gellike consistency so it is lightweight and absorbs quickly I like to add in a few drops of vitamin C serum and it mixes very well It is also unscented for those who are sensitive to fragrance A very little bit goes a long way with this product so the 17 oz size has lasted me months and Im still only about halfway through the bottle making the price pretty incredible for such a

me a while to pull the trigger but it was worth the money I noticed an immediate improvement in the wearability of my makeup after I started using this primer My foundation goes on a bit smoother and it lasts longer throughout the day before starting to look dewy I have oily skin It also has a very nice subtle citruslike smell and feels very satinysoft I used to think primers were a gimmicky product that didnt really do anything but I think this product has changed my mind I decided to pick it up because of Jeffree Star and Im happy I did\\nread more LOVE Smells great and keeps my make on and on place The first time I wore it my boyfriend asked me what my new perfume was but it was the smell of the bobbi brown he was smelling Great scent very moisturizing without making skin oily Love using this in my morning routine as it also saves time because I dont need to apply moisturizer then separate primer At first wasnt sure if the high price was worth it maybe I should stick with separate moisturizer and separate primer but when I thought of the cost of purchasing two separate products seemed like the cost would be similar Very pleased with product Will buy again\\nread more I love this I have super oily skin and its the best primer I have used Keeps me matte and is not drying I will keep buying this all in one primer and moisturizer is a total delight my skin feels hydrated and the more I used it the more I noticed the condition of my skin improve as a primer it functions as it should creating a smoother canvas for cosmetics to hang on to I cant rightfully review this without mentioning the smell I am a person with a very sensitive nose and weird I know my nose and my mouth are pretty interchangeable I can taste smells and A LOT of products I cant use because of it for instance I love the look and feel of Too Faced Dew You foundation but cant wear it because I can taste it all day this primer however has a gorgeous smell that seems natural and doesnt leave an artificial or perfumy taste in my mouth The picture I included is of me wear your primer but NO foundation I would NEVER have done that before using this for about 34 weeks I love recommend and will continue to purchase\\nread more kinda love it mostly the smell but it also makes my skin very fun to touch As a primer this doesnt do any pore filling and I dont notice that it increases wear time to any noticeable degree But what it does do  and does it amazingly  is prep your skin to a moisture level that is prime and ready for foundation It seems to just normalize skin moisture so that your foundation seeps in nicely and imparts a sort of glow to the final outcome I dont use this on very humid days But being in Vegas humidity is not a big issue On hot summer days I also dont use this because my combo skin doesnt need more moisture But for the rest of the year especially on days where my regular moisturizer feels like it wasnt quite enough  this is the primer I go to I scoop out a small amount onto my palm and dab a bit onto my cheeks forehead and chin and then I rub it in all over including my eyes prior to putting on foundation\\nread more I have combo skin that leans more to the oily side but I was looking for something that would give me a little bit of moisture before applying foundation This product is great Its not heavy or oily and absorbs into the skin beautifully It doesnt make me breakout and helps my matte foundation look less flat 100 recommended worth the price This product is so smilie t and hydrating has the beat smell and is just the perfect under makeup base I love it I have looked for the perfect moisturizer and primer for a LONG time and this is it The holy grail It is lovely when applied before my Bobbi Brown foundation Its the best Ive ever used I have used this for a long time It is wonderful moisturizer I leaves my skin soft and moisturized all winter long It is great under your foundation Bobbi Brown has some of my favorite things brushes pencil and regular eyeshadows and a terrific gel eyeliner that doesnt budge I am blown away by this primer Ive used SO MANY PRIMERS during the course of the last few years From Nars to Ole Henriksens Banana Bright to Too Faced to Smashbox to Milk Makeup HydroGrip to Lancôme and the list goes on None of them worked as well as this one My skin is combination and acne prone with some texture This stuff is a dream it smells amazing and dries smoothly and its not sticky My makeup looks great all day even after a 10 hour shift  I only powder around my noseforehead about one to two times throughout the shift But I highly recommend this even for the price  it is soooooo worth it\\nread more Perfect primer This is great for dry skin I use it along with a pore filling primer and it helps keep me moisturized and my skin looking hydrated throughout the day It does have a strong orange like scent so beware if you are sensitive It reminds me of cleaning products The only thing I dont like is the packaging isnt very sanitary since you have to dip in every time I adore the luxurious moisture this product gives me day night it doesnt matter it works the fragrance is like walking through a rose garden after a summer rain the texture is so light and creamy it absorbs quickly while still giving a glow to my skin i adore it I love this brand

one and I just love it I like the smell of this cream not to strong but just as I expected Its also good for the dryness will buy it again Love the texture and smell of this moisturizer A small amount goes a very long way as well and the packaging is luxurious I mostly use it as my night moisturizer because it is borderline heavy and I have oily skin This would definitely be great for dry skin I

alcohol\\nread more This is my favorite moisturizer Ive used so far Usually moisturizer can clog my poresexacerbate my acne over time but my acne has actually been clearing up Its not clearing up

concealer that matches your shade for pimples dark spots etc but that is to be expected as it is a BB cream It doesnt make your face look flat so you can get away with not contouring which I love because I dont like contouring that much It is extremely versatile Fantastic tinted moisturizer The texture and coverage is perfect When my skin is on the drier side I do need to layer some moisture under this as it alone is not enough in cold dry months I have sensitive skin that is prone to being red but I never have any issues with the Tarte line or this product Do check the coloring suggestions as I am fair skinned but tend to need to go one level higher than usual with this product I use the The POREfessional Hydrate Primer under this tinted moisturizer and it REALLY makes my face look significantly better and brighter I choose this brand because they are cruelty free and ranked well with the EWG\\nread more Amazing BB cream It has a light feel but build able coverage I love everything Tarte I use this product every Summer when I want just super light and natural coverage And this does perfect job without making my skin break out at all Since this product Ive used other foundation from TARTE And all of them dont make my skin break out at all I just purchased this product but so far Im very happy its only been 2 days I have super oily skin Im 38 I dont wear foundation or much makeup daytoday but I wanted something to even out my skin tone This product is light and blends easily after a few hours Im still matte which never happens and my skin looks natural and even Everything I was hoping for worth the price Very easy to apply and seems to be good for my skin too Not heavy at all I replaced my Laura Marcier tinted moisturizer with this one and I am so glad I did This is a great product stays on nicely all day nice coverage without being cakey I think I found a perfect replacement I absolutely love this I wanted something light and natural looking that I could wear every day but also for date nights and this is perfect I also like that I can build it up on days that I need more coverage and it doesnt look caked on I have very dry skin and have a really hard time finding foundationbbcc creams that dont end up flaky and separated on my face This tinted moisturizer is great because its thick enough for good coverage but the consistency isnt so heavy that it ends up cakey The shade range seems limited but this is one of the only products Ive found that actually matches my skin tone well I think because it is a tinted moisturizer and therefore isnt as pigmented as other foundations\\nread more Love this I usually wear tinted moisturizers mostly in the summer months because its a light formula but as winter is here  I find I still want to use itNow Im layering in for more full coverage and still get the moisturizing benefits It feels great on my skin  Ive been using Tartes Amazonian Clay BB Tinted moisturizer for 23 years now I dont wear foundation bc I have freckles and dont like the way it looks This BB moisturizer blends perfectly with my skin tone and I think it helped to even it out over time Love that it has SPF 20 I wear it everyday If you have dry skin this product is for you Smells good very moisturizing Love this moisturizer Its thick which I tend to like so you dont need much to cover the face and neck Even hours after application my skin feels hydrated and plumped I replaced two products with this and was thrilled They should really make this with SPF so I can pats down my routine even more I cant even count how many moisturizers Ive tried I have oily breakout prone skin so Ive been looking for something that doesnt make my face shiny or tacky I usually never reorder a skin care product because it either makes me look like I dunked my head in coconut oil breaks my skin out or makes me dry and flakey But let me tell you this is the king of moisturizers I use it at night and use dr jart cicapar calming gel cream during the day and this combo is the holy grail My skin is so much less oily no breakouts and my skin is glowing Bravo Dr Jart bravo Buy the big one you wont regret it\\nread more Great stuff  Smells good not greasy  Fan ve usted all day  My favourite moisturizer of all time Gentle fragrance and amazing texture My skin hasnt seen a dry patch since Honestly this product has worked wonders for my combination and acne prone skin I get bad hormonal cystic acne and have been told to stay away from the thick moisturizers that I love because of it This is thick and feels super moisturizing but it does not break me out or make my skin feel congested A little goes a long way and Ive seen a great improvement in the irritation Looove it Its one of the best creams in my life My skin very moisturized and has nice and healthy glow Where have you been all my life My skin has been sooo dry and irritated this winter and for whatever reason its taken me forever to try this stuff The Ceramidin liquid in conjunction with this is HG product status This cream is super thick but sinks into my skin so well I can wear it day or night I get the hype now Received as 100 point perk and I love it because right now in Hawaii the weather is very bipolar and I live in a raining area So my combinationsensitive skin deals with the dryness and it helped me calm down my skin This stuff is amazing I have dehydrated skin and this helps keep my skin nice and hydrated and dewy I live in the tropics but my skin is very dry and I also work under AC So my skin gets even more dry This cream feels so smooth and nourishing Have been using it for several days day and night and my skin looks like when I was 25 Highly recommended I have eczema and this plus Herbivore EMERALD oil have BLESSED my skin Not only helped with the dryness but also toned down my redness as well I use this first thing in the morning typically before I start my makeup routine and after I wash my face before I go to bed First used it as a sample from a little set and had to buy the full size What a godsend during the winter time Being new to the dry weather Ive exclusively been using this as my main moisturizer to repair all the damage done throughout the day It works so well I dont know how I survived without it before Saved my skin from the ravages of Canadian winter Wish I had known about it sooner One tube bought in November is still going strong into Feb I love love love it Not sure if it works the same during the warmer months Maybe just for night then Will find out definitely plan to continue using Tip Apply it to wet skin then massage It traps the moisture in I have very dry and sensitive skin but this worked wonders Its a little pricey but worth the investment Doesnt clog my pores and gives me a nice hydrated glow Also intertwined and somewhat hidden in the box is a little plastic thing to help push product out Dont throw away the box with out it Life saver for when youre running low Ive tried multiple skin care lines lower end ones and high end ones I ALWAYS return to the Clinque line My skin is very prone to breakouts and I find this to be one of the only moisturizers I can use that wont cause a breakout while offering the moisture my skin needs I perfect combination not too light not too heavy Been using this for a decade Any time I have tried something else my skin doesnt look as good Dewy hydrating and not greasy The bottle lasts a long time too I got this moisturizer for my birthday I have combination dry skin and had dry flaky patches on my forehead nose and right eyelid My makeup would cling to these areas and make it look bad But you had to be up close to see it My forehead was my biggest problem area Ive only used this TWICE Two times And my dry spots were gone Its like magic Id love to see what my skin looks like with the rest of the system\\nread more I love Cliniques DDML Ive used it for 45 years I have tried to replace it with other moisturizers along the way but nothing works as well Its great for night and day and it works especially well under makeup I have normal skin with a tendency to contact dermatitis There are certain ingredients I cant use DDML has never caused problems It is fragrance free I also use the Clinique mild bar soap for cleansing Ive never found anything to replace that either A lot of cleansers for example Cetaphil give me a rash In the worst months of winter I sometimes use Moisture Surge Intense over this People still compliment me on my skin I have very few lines smooth texture and I dont have enlarged pores One caveat know your skin type Cleansers and moisturizers are geared to skin type If you have oily skin this will probably be too much moisture\\nread more This is by far my favorite moisturizer I love the whole 3 step system Even when I try new cleaners I still fall back on this moisturizer The only moisturizer that works for skin Doesnt break me out and it gives me a nice glow Ive tried different one but I always come back to this one My go to moisturizer I have combination to dry skin and my skin feels still tight and dry with other moisturizers but this one works well with my skin Its light but moisturize my skin well Ive been using it for a while now It works exactly the same way that is says it does I have very dry skin and it left my skin dewy soft and moisturized Although I have combination skin it became very dry when I moved to a new climate I was introduced to this product by a friend and found that it worked really well and did not cause me any outbursts of acne as most moisturizers have It is a great solution for those with combination skin who live in dry climates I love this product I always find myself going back to this moisturizer Its lightweight and not greasy feeling on my face I recommend that everyone tries it My face feels so hydrated and it doesnt break me out Im not sure that this is supposed to have properties that clear my skin but I noticed a HUGE difference in my redness after just one day of using this I have UBER sensitive skin and this is just a wonderful product I dont find that it sit on top of my skin its not greasy and it really does hydrate I use this at night but have no doubt it would lay very nicely under makeup or just on its own This product is very moisturizing and easily repairs dry skin I love love love this product Makes my skin feel hydrated but doesnt feel heavy at all Have bought tons of bottles of this stuff and will always have a bottle on hand even if I find something else I like I always wear this under my make up Have tried samples of so many other moisturizers and this doesnt irritate my skin Ive been using this moisturizer for years and years now and yet Ive only gone through 3 bottles It lasts for SO long  the price is very fair for what you get I use this every night during the day I prefer the Clinique Jelly or Chanel Camelia Water and its wonderful  the texture is very rich but lightweight at the same time dont know how they pulled that off it feels so comfortable on the skin and you only need very very little If you use too much you might not like it  less is more with this one I only use half a pump because its not necessary at all to use more It leaves my skin supple and hydrated and this is coming from someone using RetinA I love it and the fact that it comes in a pump makes me love it even more\\nread more I love this lotion  I got it as a sample on my sephora play box 6 months ago and havent stopped using it I have really dry skin and its been the best thing Ive ever used  I really recommend it Holy Grail I have been looking for a moisturizer that actually soaks into my face instead sitting on top of it but doesnt leave my face feeling heavy I actually use this as a day cream and for the first time in over a decade went foundation free because of the nice glow and radiance this gives my skin The smell is a but musty like old gym shoes but it doesnt linger at all once you rub it in I went my whole life thinking my skin was super oily Id try moisturizer after moisturizer and they all just sat ontop of my skin making it even more oily I recently found out my skin is actually dry and the moisturizers I was using werent penetrating the skin to actually provide the moisture This moisturizer is the only one that actually works My true test of a good moisturizer is if I wake up in the morning after washing my face and using the moisturizer the night before and seeing if my skin is oily The first time I tried it I was so pleasantly surprised I never write reviews for products but I felt this one deserved it Seriously if you feel like youve tried everything and want to give up try this first\\nread more It took me about a week to fall in love with it I dont care about the lack of scent I prefer unscented but I dont smell what others smell Its just a scent free cream Theres no crazy odor I use

overall youthful appearance\\nread more I got this in a sample size and I really like it I have oilycombination skin and it didnt break me out at all Its a great moisturizer when your skin is feeling dry and I also noticed the lines on my forehead less visible It does have a weird smell when applied to the face but it goes away right after This product was very hydrating and it made my skin feel very smooth and soft Oftentimes Squalane leaves my skin feeling greasy but this cream didnt leave a shiny residue on my face Im definitely considering buying a full size This is a game changer I was stuck using FRESH night time moisturizer to try and keep the dryness at bay in the winter on the PNW I wanted to step away from fragrance and have tried unsuccessfully to find something that wouldnt agitate my acne pronesensitive skin until now This moisturizer is incredible My skin isnt dry anymore which I never thought possible and looking so dewy and clear Best moisturizer Ive ever used Worth the money\\nread more I got this free with my points only because I didnt like the other options Im thrilled that I actually used it because it is the best cream I have ever found for my combination oily clog prone skin I am 59 years old and the last year or so my cheeks have been getting very dry and nothing I tried really seemed to help Even with moisturizer and a hydrating foundation my skin still looked dry and lackluster I have to be careful what I use on my skin because it is very prone to clogging and whiteheads so I had started layering several lighter weight products to try to moisturize my skin This cream is like a miracle First of all there is no detectable fragrance which I love It hydrates my skin beautifully yet does not cause my pores to clog or cause breakouts Wears beautifully under makeup I have been using it morning and night since I tried it and I am going to Sephora today to buy the full size jar I would give this cream 100 stars if I could it is that

for my dark circles and gives skin a generally healthier feel as well I will be purchasing the full size AMAZING My skin has never looked better  it is so soft and very hydrating I had dry spots on my face that have completely disappeared AMAZING I live in Colorado and this winter has been brutal on my skin Im sensitivedryred and this is doing a wonderful job of evening out skin tone with a great amount of hydration and NO BREAK OUTS Even my husband is stealing this from me if you are thinking about it go for it The price is worth it My complexion is evening out so much Honestly I love this product so much I cant wait to see what more progress my skin makes as time goes on using this The smell is amazing and soft You wont notice it once you put it on your face But the oil itself is AMAZING It sinks in really fast leaves your skin soft and wont break you out My skin actually got less oily and way more even since using this Id go as far to say that my skin type is now more normal than combination Amazing The smell is horrible And it took a while for me to be able to tolerate the smell However once you can get past the horrible lavender smell this stuff is a miracle oil Everyone I know has raved about this product for years and I received a free sample and I figured I would try it out and I liked the results from the week the sample lasted so I decided to invest in a whole bottle of it I have been using it for around 3 months now I have an almost natural redness to my skin that I have always associated with having very sensitive skin Like washing my face with just water will make my face red Even with like the gentle dermatologist recommended CeraVe face wash my face is red for like 15 minutes afterwards I have noticed with continued use of this MRC that my face is much less red and irritated by other products I love that when I wake up my face is even toned and glowy My skin is very dry in the winter and this has helped prevent and get rid of all of my dry patches I am excited to try the Daily Reviving Concentrate since that smell is citrus so I will likely actually enjoy that smell My only concern is that this will end up being a winter only product since my skin is so oily in the summer But I am used to having different products in the summer months than I use for the winter months The only other important thing I would as about this oil is that if you have any big blemishes coming out just know this will make them come out much faster but also it will make their life much shorter which is definitely a plus\\nread more I love how

became more even the texture smoothed and my skin was baby butt soft Also the scent is so lovely and indulgent before bed I randomly received this as a toss off from my bestie who didnt like the oily feeling it gave her right after applying We both buy a lot of skin care products and usually pass on things to the other if it doesnt work for us because our skin types are completely opposite So glad I actually gave this a go though because it completely changed the texture of my skin after about two weeks of nightly use Im obsessed with it and have since repurchased it in the large size I stopped using it when trying a new product a few months back and quickly regretted the switch and realized what a difference this stuff truly makes to the overall condition of my skin This product makes my

already used it more then 3 years and so happy that I found it one day Highly recommended  This product has taken the place of three separate steps in my make up routine I used to apply primer liquid foundation and a matte powder foundation I found my skin was looking dry and cakey so I decided to give this stuff a shot I LOVE it It goes on smooth and velvety and lasts all day It is very buildable as well Just a layer of this with a little bronzer and setting powder and Im good to go So thankful its cut out some time from my morning routine\\nread more Perfect coverage and silky soft  goes on evenly and lasts all day I LOVE this BB primer Its a little price and the package is small but it feels and looks SO NICE on my skin Im using it in lieu of any foundation It provides great natural coverage and a healthy glow I got a compliment on my skin on the first day I wore it Love it Just know that if you are oily you may want a setting powder I sometimes use it with my cover FX or on its own for days when I want something lighter Love this stuff Ive been using the IT Matte CC for a while and like it but it seemed to rub off on everything Tried Tarte based on a friends recommendation and it did it disappoint Mousselike feel very smooth and surprisingly buildable coverage Very very happy with this product Would definitely recommend to those who dont need a heavy face of full coverage makeup Im 40 years old with combo skin and this doesnt irritate or cause breakouts\\nread more This has been my goto primer for 3 plus years now Love that it has an SPF 30 Literally makes my skin feel like cashmere and helps cover up the excess redness I have in my cheeks I wear this alone when I want to have a more natural look So great would highly recommend One of the few beauty products that I continue to buy year after year Soft and silky great coverage I use this in place of foundation as I have yet to find any foundationany brandthat feels as nice as this and naturally evens out my skin like this product does I would cry buckets if Tarte ever stopped making it My only suggestion would be that the tube can get messy this would work much better as a pump\\nread more Im so happy that the high reviews were on point for me I love this product and wear it every day I love the matted look it gives me Im superoily and how it makes my skin look even Its light enough for every day wear The only suggestion I would make is to not use the online shade finder as it matched me with a color thats too dark Go to a physical location and try a sample before you buy Love this stuff and Ive been using it for four years now Not too runny like some BB creams not too heavy this is perfect Usually I wear this on its own and its enough to cover my acne scars and smooth my complexion while still looking very natural Also works well under foundation and as a base for eye shadow FYI I always apply sunscreen with it even though theres SPF built in because youd have to really paint this on in order to get sufficient coverage\\nread more I am 57 and I use this without anything else It says it is a primer but unless Im going someplace special all I need is this and basic makeup and Im done Ive never used a product that is so easy to use and makes my face flawless and natural I have been using this product for years and love the smooth finish and buildable coverage I often will wear this with nothing else for the sunscreen protection and some light coverage very natural look not oily and it absorbs quickly if you want to build overtop Ive been using this for years its just enough coverage without looking over done Like a magic eraser for your face evens skin tone and adds a layer of SPF protection If they ever discontinue it I dont know what Ill do with myself wish it came in a lighter color but other than that perfect This product is amazing  people who are saying this makes their skin shinyoily DUH Its a cream Put it on let it have 5 min to settleoxidize like any other BB cream or foundation then put powder on it POWDER Stop giving things bad reviews when you dont understand how makeup products work I got this product with my Sephora points and I erroneously immediately assumed that it would be too dark for me so I gave it to one of my friends But before I handed it to her I tried some on the back of my hand and it was amazing It made my skin look luminous and radiant and it blended down very well I definitely want to go back and buy some this product soon I have gone through about 3 of these I love the Dewey finish and it doesnt leave my dry skin looking patchy My only qualm is with the packaging I have broken the cap on every single bottle cause it doesnt really seem to stay onstill love it though This is my favorite for allinone skincare moisturizer foundation Great coverage long lasting and its so easy to just put this on in the morning instead of moisturizer spf and makeup I really like this product Its a bit pale to me seems like it kind of has pink undertones so it doesnt work that well if you want to build it up cause then it wont match but I use a tiny dollop so its not noticeable I like the way it goes on though and the fact that it has spf is a plus Smooth and silky texture I love how it feels like nothing is on your face but provides SPF coverage  No scent This is by far my favorite foundation I feel like Ive tried everything but I keep returning to my BB The coverage is not heavy It smoothies and evens everything out beautifully I have large pores and foundations and other BB or CC creams seem to sink in to them making it very clear that Im wearing makeup This stuff hovers above my skin like a blurring veil Ill never stray again BB This formula is absolutely incredible Perfect for no makeup days and can also use for a full face if my skin is in good shape It has pretty decent coverage but is totally undetectable It looks super natural and glowy on the skin Also love the high amount of SPF I would be very sad if this ever got discontinued bb creams have changed my life Im blessed with naturally good skin and for years I would wear these heavy pigmented foundations without realizing that a much lighter bb cream would suffice I love the natural look that this beauty balm gives my skin and also protects from UV rays never going back to the heavy stuff if I can help it  tho time may prove otherwise lol I have been using this BB for about 5 years now and this is my updated review I started wearing this around 2526 and I am now going on 32 I do a lot of experimenting with new skincare and makeup I have tried dozens of other BB  CC creams but this champ comes out on top every time There are two constants in my regimen this BB and the Ole Henrickson vitamin C Brightening Wipes I stopped wearing a full face but I still use this everyday I can feel my skin asking for it After many years of use heres what I have to report Sun damage wrinkles uneven skin tone and texture have all been mitigated by this product It is not a doall but it makes my skin happy AF The SPF is great because its physical not chemical It has helped fade old acne scarring and helps my skin to stay young and glowy My biggest complaint is that it can transfer aggressively if not set properly You have to give it time to soak in and I recommend setting it with a translucent powder\\nread more I am such a big fan of Peter Thomas Roth This cream is wonderful I use it right before I put on my makeup just to add one more step of moisture I am a flight attendant so I need all the moisture I can get The jar it comes in feels really nice the product last a long time I mean a long time A little goes a long way I scoop it out and put in a smaller jar to throw in

going to get something from first aid but and employee showed me this this before is just from one use in the same 5 minutes so much relief im going to continue to use this This product is my absolute favorite moisturizer that Ive tried and in combination with the Clarisonic Murads salicylic cleanser PTRs Cloud Drench Cream Cleanser PTRs Cloud Drench serum and Sunday Rileys Luna Oil it has been absolutely transformative to my skin The consistency is more like a gel to water and it absorbs within a minute leaving skin plump and glowy The smell is incredibly light  as someone who gets sensory

predominant A friend swear by the essence water and while I still think the price is a little steep I decided to give it a try Its been a month now and I noticed my lines are less viable than before I use the essence on my regular morning and night routines Love love love the Essence Cannot do my skincare routine without it It has become irreplaceable It immediately hydrates and softens skin and you can feel your serums and creams absorb much better A must have This is my favorite Tatcha product I will ALWAYS recommend it Great at plumping and softening the skin Sometimes when I use it at night its all I need and I can skip a nighttime moisturizer Leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft and if you want to let your skin breathe and not feel clogged than this is perfect for that I literally wake up with baby face skin in the morning after using this product I am on my second bottle of this Essence I love the way it makes your skin feel after washing very soft and moisturized I cannot believe it took me so long to find the perfect skincare item This essence has dramatically changed my skin for the better in just one night Mind you I have normal to combination skin and have never had any skin problems so this essence might not deliver the same results for people with different skin typesconditions This essence plumped my skin up so beautifully its unreal my skin has never felt more soft before This also ridded me of my pores on my cheeks in about two nights and has diminished pores on my nose within a week My trick for the best results is to pour a few drops onto damp palms and then apply to a damp face I tried with dry hands and dry skin but it felt a bit sticky and didnt apply as smoothly and evenly as it does with damp skin and you end up using more product I start out by gently tapping product over my face and finish off by rubbing in circular motions all over until absorbed This is the 1 product I would recommend to anyone even for the price its beyond worth it Ive been trying to find a product to get rid of pores and this is THE thing to try if youre looking for the same thing I swear by Tatcha\\nread more I noticed a huge change in the plumpness

applying the rest of your skin care Of course wait until the essence is absorbed but a little damp\\nread more This has been the icing on the cake to my skincare regimen In the past I have been skeptical of using an essence or toner because of those I have tried I didnt really notice a difference After a month of using this morning and night my skin is soft supple and so smooth As someone

Influenster Vox Box campaign and have received this product complimentary in order to test and provide an honest review As a fan and user of the Perricone MD line of skin care I am thrilled to be able to test this neck cream and share my thoughts First of all I am a woman of a certain age 61 to be exact and I have the same concerns that all women of my age group dospecifically sagging skin and loss of elasticity As someone who works in a youthobsessed industry my appearance is critical and something that I strive to nurture and maintain I have always utilized highend skin care products with Perricone MD being one of my goto brands Thus when I received this Perricone MD Neck Treatment I was psyched to give it a whirl First impression  the product is not greasy and does not possess an overpowering fragrance Ive been applying it every morning and right before bedtime A little goes a long wayso although the cream is pricey it doesnt take much product to complete an application The product absorbs quickly into the skin and doesnt leave a sticky film To be fair I have not used this longterm but only for 2 weeks however I can say that I am pleased with the results Ive seen in such a short span of time I dont expect miracles from any cream serum or lotion but this product does exactly what it claims to do  I see a visible difference in the firmness in my jawline and neck area I would definitely recommend Perricone MD Cold Plasma SubDNeck Treatment As with all of the Perricone MD products that Ive invested in this cream is consistent with the rest of the brand I know I can always buy Perricone MD with confidence as it performs and provides the desired results\\nread more Jaw dropping results This cream has no scent I received this complimentary to try and review and

so many products for my neck and decollete and this is the first product where Ive actually noticed an improvement in my skin This product is absolutely amazing I am 46 years old and startes noticing severe deep wrinkles on my neckdecolletage and loose sagging skin on my neck It was starting to bother me so much I started researching cosmetic surgeries Ive always been told I look 30s but my neck was starting to look 70 I sleep on my side and large breasts which caused very deep lines across my chest I was embarrassed to wear v neck tops Within one week of using Perricone Sub D Neck I could see dramatic improvement 3 weeks later and the lines on my chest are gone My neck skin is firm and no longer crepey I apply it along my chin and jawline as well and this area is firm and much more defined The price is out of my budget but with these results I will cut costs somewhere else to continue having this in my life I see many people complaining about the smell IMO it 1st smells like a clean pleasant light citrus scent After a few moments it does develop a somewhat fishy smell But it isnt bad I dont tolerate bad smells well Its more of a fresh uncooked fish smell rather than a nasty fish odor I just think of the smell as a positive that it is doing amazing work while I sleep Worth every penny\\nread more This stuff smells fine Not perfumy but certainly not fish Id say if anything foodlike it reminds me a bit of a lemon vinaigrette And thats the way it smelled to me 4 or 5 years ago too Has nothing to do with a formula being changed Just how my nose works I wonder if the fish smell is something genetic kinda like the way some people taste soap when they eat cilantro I am in my 50s I got a small size in a random product sampler so I tried it I very small bottle lasted 30 days Even my husband noticed that my neck looked tighter I have to tell you I have never had a product work like this before Is there a smell Yes it is not awful and goes away in about 10 min I was starting to notice my neck looking like chicken skin I used my body lotion to moisturize everyday but it was not doing the trick I tried Cold Plasma and everyday my neck was looking better and better

odor\\nread more I really love this stuff Makes my makeup look a bit more hydrated after setting with powder Wow I absolutely love how this feels and looks on my face I have very dry skin and it keeps

have to say it works Within 10 minutes of spraying my skin is plump dewy and it glows Its a fantastic makeup refresher too It makes my pores look smoother and my makeup look like my skin It also

sizes to try them out and I love them I will be buying them all in the full sizes I use this mist before and after my moisturizer It gives the perfect dewy look and feels so moisturizing It doesnt seem like much is coming out of the bottle because the spritz is so light so I have gone through it so quickly that really only 3 pumps is enough I use urban decay as my finishing spray to lock in

become one of my favourites\\nread more Love this mist over my makeup Its super moisturizing and leaves a nice dewy glow Ive never written a product review before but this skin mist is so good I had

enhances the oil on my skin after taking 5 steps Absorbs really well Amazing for Oily skinits light weightdoesnt cause any after oilinessI just wish it has spf in it as a combination skin type Ill say its a really suitable for me during winter and also summer It dose moisture my face but not oily it absorbs well after applied A nice neutral moisturizer with a light scent In the summer I use Olehenriksen Oil Control the green one to keep my skin more matte but this one is nice for the winter I have tried so many face creams for my extremely acne prone skin and always come back to this one Its been more gentle than Tatchas water cream but more hydrating than Freshs deep moisture rose cream One of my Never Run Outs I have been using this face cream for over a year now and its a staple to my skin care regimen I also use other olehenriksen products inlcludinv their Vitamim C Serum and eye cream Their products are great quality and truly deliver results I love using this lotion under my makeup and feels lightweight under my tinted moisturizer Recently I have only been wearing alone without any tinted moisturizer and I love how it makes my skin love and feel My skin tone texture has perfected over time fr using these products along with my monthly facials Its lightweight and does not irritate my skin I have somewhat combination skin Oily TZone and sometimes dry on my cheeks At the end of the day I always tend to look a little shiny The jar will last me quite a while a little goes a long way I also love their travel size version I can take one with me for 10 day vacation and it will last the whole trip\\nread more One of the only products that Ive tried where I can clearly see that my skin is brighter It also doesnt clog pores and make my skin so much smoother AND it helps with my dryness This is a basic moisturizer its good but really nothing to write home about If you have extremely dry skin this probably wont work for you It is lightweight kind of a silky texture no fragrance and sinks into skin fairly quickly What I like best about this product though is how well it seems to work with all my other products toners serums oilsetc Some moisturizers seem to get weird when layered on top of other skin care like pilling or bunching up This never seems to do that I also really like the way this looks under foundation it basically doubles as a primer This is a product I dont necessarily reach for everyday but I do like having it in rotation\\nread more Great product that really does make your skin look more bright and evens out skin tone I was breaking out horribly until a Sephora worker recommended this to me now my skin is so good Cream takes time to show results Would purchase again I took a break from using this and tried other brands but this is hands down one of the best moisturizers that I have ever used If you are looking for something hydrating this is it for you It hydrates your skin without giving it a greasy finish Very nice light cream Absorbs right away My skin was getting very dry from the winter air and this helped right away I bought this after reading and hearing a lot of good reviews This facial oil is the one of the few oils that penetrates within a few minutes and leaves my skin moisturised without feeling greasy I wake up with my skin feeling hydrated and not stretchy I use this oil at night as the final step to my skincare This would also be perfect for day time use in the winter as well Love it I have hormonal acne and Ive been using this for over a year and it really made a complete difference in my breakouts and skin tone I 100 recommend this product and even when used twice a day it should last around 6 months I am on my third bottle I use morning and night sometimes over moisturizer and sometimes underneathThe dropper is pretty much useless when the oil gets low but I am so in love with the product I will give it a pass I really feel this has improved the texture and evened the tone of my skin This is a must have product for me received this as a part of a favorites package have used ordinarys rosehip oil and other rose products which ive loved but the only other vit c product i used was way too harsh for my skin this was so perfect did not sting at all i put it on AM on clean skin on a day i wasnt leaving the house and put moisturizer at night without even cleansing at night next day i can definitely notice my complexion looks so much better did not break me out my skin just looks wonderfully plump and all i used other than this product past 24 hrs is moisturizer last night and sunscreen in the morning today i love it probably will use oncetwice a week along with my differin and azelaic acid\\nread more Love this Skin is super smooth and silky  an excellent product to use

this product a chance I also love the smell Thank you Biossance So a mini size of this came with the Squalene value set and at first I was really skeptical and didnt use this right away because I have oily skin and Ive always had this misconception of oils  oily skin  Nono but lordttt I was missing out I had a really bad hormonal imbalance around the holidays so I broke out and couldnt help but pick and pop the pimples A few months later and I finally decided to give this a try and omggg the results were amazing My face is moisturized but not greasy the dark spots are slowly fading I also had dry cracked peeling sensitive lips really gross like as if I was doing meth used a humidifier but it only dried them out worse nothing worked for months I also had a bald patch on my eyelashes from curling them daily then one day I got too aggressive and ripped off a bunch I noticed after a few months of applying this oil to my lips and eyes as serum that my lashes have grown so fast and they curl up now My lips are always moisturized I dont have to reapply my lip chap The price is justified because it literally did wonders for me\\nread more I have combination skin that is also super sensitive and I use this to moisturize at night It has totally helped my skin to look more radiant and even plus its not dry at all when I wake up in the morning even though where I live is usually not very humid I know the price is not appealing but I use three drops a night and I predict this large size will last me for so long as I made it a sample size I received that was tiny last a

also finally found a good face wash and moisturizer so i have a great skin care routine going on now which is a miracle in its self Today i have not 1 pimple on my face and my redness is getting better and better by the week if you have REALLY dry skin your gonna need to pair this with a good hydrating moisturizer This oil sinks into the skin so beautifully The skin literally just drinks it up You could use this even if you have oily skin i would say its good for ALL skin types including acne prone and extremely sensitive skin This oil has become my holy grail and i will never be without

to look more radiant and even plus its not dry at all when I wake up in the morning even though where I live is usually not very humid I know the price is not appealing but I use three drops a night

I found out Sephora wasnt carrying it anymore Was extatic to hear that the AMOREPACIFIC product was a very similar product as I have pretty sensitive and acne prone skin and product changeups especially with makeup have notoriously not gone well for me This product is fantastic and although a little on the pricer side comes with two cushion packages so double the product you would expect

humid climate but in Central Oregon it is dry This product keeps my skin supple and looking youthful but not oily I was very skeptical about this product loved the fact that it had SPF thats a must but it also said light coverage Well Im one who needs at least medium to full coverage but this here proved me wrong Its light but it covers alot for what I need to cover up I have a few dark spots

that makeup feeling A sephora manager told me about this product I was reluctant because it reminded me of high school days plowing pancake foundations and powders throughout the day That was awful This stuff is AMAZING I feel like Im putting a moisturizer on my face or a light mask It lasts nearly all day long depending on how active I am I never need to touch up more than once a day if at all

provides a nice lightmedium coverage It doesnt look cakey at all Most facial oil blends are so egregiously overpriced that I dont bother and just stick to buying wholesale single oils but Ive been needing to up both my moisturization and my antioxidants and the reviews convinced me to try this Im so glad I did Its very easy to spread which means that three drops really does cover my large face It can be used around my eyes without going in them and ruining my vision which is more than can be said of some creams and enables me to treat the areas that need it most Its a dry oil and absorbed

product has fragrance in it its the last ingredient so I wouldnt really bother much Natural fragrance doesnt provide benefit for skin and can have some downsides too Apart from that I believe this is one of the best oils in the market according to the ingredient list and I have looked from normal brand to hiend brand Ive finished two or three bottles so far best Ive ever used Lasts a long time  Ive read that flax is not that stable and I ordered this oil from ebay once and it came in a slightly darker color than the bottle I got from sephora That might be oxidization that you might have to be concerned Im sure the label is slightly different from the sephora bottle must have come from older production So I guess one thing to keep in my is use it consistently when you buy it\\nread more i have very dry acne prone skin Most things I try break me out This oil has been incredible Whenever I use it I wake up and my skin and so clear and soft It definitely has some exfoliating properties

super oily skin that includes a lot of black heads I use this just about every night under my moisturizing serum or i will use it as a cleansing oil To use as a cleansing oil  i warm about 7 or 8 drops between my palms and then massage it into my skin for about 2 minutes  ring out a warm wash cloth and lay it over your face and take some deep breaths as it cools then gently wipe the oil off

drinks it up I love this product My skin care regimen definitely includes this At first it was a little sticky for about a week Afterwards my skin adjusted and now its soft and supple I got this with my points and I have to agree with other reviewers that this stuff lasts a long time I put it on after my shower when I do my routine sleep and wake up and I can still feel the cream on my face but it doesnt feel like a film it just feels really hydrated I dont find the smell that strong When first out of the package yes but it doesnt last This is my goto product for dealing with rosacea flares especially in cold weather A little goes a long way But this recovery balm does what it claims for my sensitive skin I use it only when my face is feeling irritated and is dry esp winter so basically I am using this about 23 times a week and I really adore it Also whenever I start to get a couple of annoying bumps or pimples cuz you know sensitive skin I use this the night of and by the morning the pimples start to go down I am using two Ren products this one and the vit c moisturizer and the two work really well for my combo sensitive skin I would definitely repurchase with my hard earned money\\nread more This balm is magic It has taken care of my dry wintery skin better than any other product I have tried Goes on smooth doesnt irritate and is super gentle Highly recommend This is hands down my favourite skincare product EVER I live in the frozen desertCalgary and its the only thing that keeps my skin hydrated It says overnight but I use it during the day as well under makeup I will never be without it I put this on at night and wake up to a very hydrated face Typically during the winter my face tends to feel very dry and this has definitely helped my skin feel moisturized A little goes a long way and it smells great This feels like butter on the face and hydrates really well Usually at night i will add a layer of this on top of my moisturizer and serums as a last step but during the day I find it a little too greasy looking so I mix a tiny amount in with my daytime moisturizer and it keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day Ive struggled with cystic acne since I was a teenager Nothing from a dermatologist or any store would help Once a break out would happen Id have to wait 2 weeks for the painful mounds to clear Not anymore This stuff is like magic for my skin Normally I like to use this 12 times a week to keep my skin feeling smooth and happy When I get a cystic acne outbreak I use it back to back for a few nights and its like it never happened I highly recommend this product\\nread more Very moisturizing for my dry sensitive skin Especially works wonders on my forehead Sinks in overnight and skin feels like silk in the morning This stuff is amazing I have sensitive pale combo skin with dry patches on my nose and cheeks and an oily Tzone I put a thin layer of it on at night over my moisturizer and when I wake up in the morning my skin is soft and much more even Ive noticed that my red spots from acne scars have disappeared over time which is a miracle because my skin is so delicate and easily damaged I will say that it does not react well with glycolic acid but I learned that through trial and error Nothing wrong with that just dont use the two together\\nread more Whenever I get acne I always resorted to this product It was first given to me as a sample which has lasted a while so a little goes a long way The product recognized I have sensitive skin there was acne there and dry skin would soon surround the pimple I would spot treat the places on my face with acne and it makes my acne go away in 3 days Its way better and safer than using a treatment with alcohol as a primary ingredient It leaves my skin super smooth in the areas I put it in and is like a healing balm for my face in just one night I bought the full size once I ran low on my sample size and I do not regret doing so One of the best products by far for my acne\\nread more I have so much love for this product Key points a little goes a long way I use it as my last step at night after serummoisturiser to seal everything in and that it does I also take a moment to do a bit of a massage to really work it in I also love it for no make up days the smallest amount gives a lovely glow Im a huge fan of the entire evercalm line so I had pretty high expectations for this and it did not disappoint Its very rich so you only need a little per use which is good since 48 is pricey and I find it to be incredibly effective after only one or two nights My skin is normaldry more so in the winter so this is perfect for when I need to replenish ASAP Its also fantastic at calming any irritation so I use it both as a night treatment andor for spotsareas I was worried that the balm would be too much on top of moisturizer but its not greasy at all Probably wouldnt use it as much in the summer unless I need to treat irritation since even though its not heavy I think it would be too much so I also wouldnt necessarily recommend it to those with oily skin Ive never had an issue with it causing congestion but Im not acneprone so I cant say for sure Overall Id still recommend it to most\\nread more Best product ever I wish it wasnt so expensive because I love it so much Its the only product that I can use on my really sensitive skin I have

moisturizers and this takes the cake I have dry sensitive eczema skin I always wake up to my face feeling tight dry  sometimes flakey I saw this in a YT video so I decided to try it and this helps so much with my dryness and my dry patches on my face Helped calm down my eczema spots and my face feels so moisturized after I put this one I hate to buy things that arent readily available nearby  the only Sephora that isnt an hour away is the one in JCPenneys and they dont carry this brand But onto the balm  it IS a balm so its the last part of a bedtime skincare drill Its amazing I have sensitive dry skin to start with but being of a certain age  sadly your skin changes with the onset of the big M  its even drier This balm gives my skin an overnight drink Im prone to rosacea and cant speak yet to whether it calms flareups Thankfully with a constellation of a 2step cleanse a emollient toner some Ordinary products  my pH barrier is healthier than its been in years This is a great addition as we head into winter\\nread more I gave REN a try last year and purchased their Flash Facial Glycolic mask and Evercalm mask I wasnt ecstatic so when I went into Sephora for the VIB sale I decided to give them another shot after hearing great reviews I am so glad I did This balm is EVERYTHING First off it is unscented which is really great for sensitive skin It absorbs amazing into the skin without leaving an oily residue Skin is supple and hydrated It is great for every night use I cant recommend this product enough if you suffer from sensitive or dry skin To add REN is also pregnancysafe which although I am not pregnant is really great to know as it really confirms them gentleness and cleanness of their products An overall great brand\\nread more Im dry and sensitive skin type Its really hard to find a cream that it suitable for me Usually It is hard to absorb well on my skin and sometimes will cause acne when using other brands The Black tea corset cream is perfect for me it was very moisturising and absorb very well on skin  it do help my skin look smoother and soft  Im also using their black tea essential water thats good too I will be 69 in November and have been using the Corset Cream and the Rose Moisturizing Cream for a few years I highly recommend both After living near beaches from my 20s through 42 I am more concerned about skin care than cosmetics and use an SPF sunscreen daily The Corset Moisturizer has a mild fragrance a luxurious creaminess and a lovely finish It is compatible with sunscreens and foundations My jawline parentheses and neck wrinkles are more firm than when I started the product And my skin is nicely moisturized even in the Colorado aridity I do not look close to 70 The Rose Moisturizer is a lovely alternative some days It smells lightly like an English garden and plumps my skin as though I am in a place with actual humidity If you are aging without facial surgery these two moisturizers and related products

times and immediately began to notice results I noticed that my skin was becoming duller due to long nights and lack of sleep I feel like all of that went away just by adding this moisturizer to my

touch of redness on my cheeks and uneven skin tone at my jaw and under my eyes I bought this 152 years ago with a gift card I received for my birthday or something after doing A LOT of research I bought the 3 pack actually and used it all until it was empty loved the way my skin looked I have since then repurchased the 3 pack a couple more times dying inside every time as its 100but thankfully it lasts a couple months at a time this time I bought strictly this night time treatment and let me tell you this is the star of that whole set I notice a difference the first morning after I used it My skin looks brighter and happier and evened out I find I break out A LOT less and its just an overall amazing product I apply this every night and if I remember correctly the bottle lasts a couple months It can pill but I find it doesnt if you let it dry before applying moisturizer Im not a huge makeup wearer and when I do i prefer sheer and glowy products so this helps my skin look the best it can so my sheer products look flawless I cannot recommend this product enough\\nread more I love this stuff I use this stuff every night This stuff is great for traveling Before I use this product I

these pimples disappear I am left with scars This product has done a wonderful job in helping to even out my skin tone Its the second time that I am purchasing this product Once I went through the

days Amazing gel ever  Love Love Love I have bought this many timesalmost like a light overnight peel Hate to run out of it Not inexpensive but IMO well worth the price This gel stings a bit from the AHA when I put it on and doesnt have a cloying smell I believe it is working and see less sun freckles than before as I exfoliate 2 or 3 times a week I put a vitamin e night creme over this before sleep My face feels so soft every day Great moisturizer Sent me an error I dont use it but the eye cream is absolutely spectacular so if this is anything like it I would recommend it I tried this after reading Caroline Hirons blog Good god it is truly amazing I wake up with supple baby soft skin every morning The downsides are that the packaging is super bulky and when I travel weekly the pressure created between the lid and container makes it impossible to open I am not exaggerating I cant open it some nights I hope they can get this sorted because it is probably the best moisturizer Ive ever used\\nread more Live this cream and used the whole jar I use some Murad products so bought this when looking for something with Hyaluronic Acid Love that the cream is very lightweight but yet very effective It evened out my skin tone and lightened some skin spots from the sun Will definitely buy again Not oily or overly moisturizing just the perfect amount skin feels sooo nice I have oily skin and havent noticed a problem with this Im using a trial of this now and I would buy it but I can get other nice moisturizers much much cheaper I have tried EVERYTHING My skin would be cracking and dry but then break out in other spots and be oily It made no sense This miracle cream cleared up the excess acne reduced oil production in problem spots and healed cracked cracked skin It moisturizes but somehow my skin no longer looks or feels oily I feel fresh all day It has been Heaven sent I never knew I needed it until I received a sample I wish those were available for purchase so everyone could try it and see why it is worth every penny Im in my 30s\\nread more Good for dry acne prone skin Does not clog pores I absolutely love this product Conbination skin must haveSuper love it in spring and summer Cant leave without it in my rest of life This moisture is good for dry skin I loved high price but its really work Love this as a daytime moisturizer It leaves my face super moisturized without being heavy or oily I have combination skin and typically reserve ultra hydrating products for my nighttime routine but found this left just the right amount of moistuization to use before makeup application My cheeks are supple AND my forehead isnt an oil slick at the end of the day Will definitely repurchase This is the ONLY moisturizer that hydrates my very dry skin The consistency is on the thicker side but it instantly soothes my skin Normally I will find a moisturizer that feels good going on the skin but a little while later I will see dry patches again When I use this I never see dry patches throughout the day Absolutely love it great way to hydrate skin use it both day and night never feels heavy on the skin and not sticky Skin is starting to feel smooth and moisturised Only have to use a little to get results Very happy with this product love this face lotion its my go to I use everyday only need a super small amount so it lasts longer than it seems like it will super super moisturizing I do however hate the container its in its unnecessarily giant and has a small hole in it where the lotion goes reminds me of getting a bag of chips and having only 13 of the bag be actual chips I can eat and the rest just air Perfect for the winter Very absorbing I really like this moisturizer It is thick enough to use as a winter moisturizer but light enough to layer under makeup easily i have very dry skin and this did the trick for me It also helped reduce fine lines and even my skin out a bit However for the price point I do think there are other moisturizers that work just as well This is no miracle worker but it is a fantastic moisturizer Very hydrating I have combination skin my forehead and nose tend to get pretty oily Most moisturizers only make it worse but this one doesnt A little goes a long way I purchased because it was on sale and the reviews were great So glad I did AMAZING Im just finishing up my third jar 1000 buying again It makes my skin feel so moisturized I put it on very night and let it soak in while I sleep 333 Im not one for writing reviews but this lotion deserves one I have very dry acne prone skin This in combination with the herbivore Phoenix oil lives my skin hydrated soft and smooth Ive tried so many moisturizers and this is by far the best Will continue to use Im super picky about moisturizers and this one is suitable for my standards Its fairly basic and doesnt wow me but it has a smooth whipped texture and quenches skin naturally without the use of dimethicone or petrolatum which is rare even for the clean moisturizers at Sephora The rose scent is extremely faint I loved that there was a sheet provided that explained the benefits of their ingredients and explained why they choose not to include certain ingredients Overall a very simple and good moisturizer\\nread more God I love this brand Its like they can do no wrong I got a mini of this in a set and the first time I used it it was like the heavens opened and the angels sang THIS is the moisturizer Ive been looking for all my life I have such dry skin and I could hear my pores singing little thank yous To be clear this is definitely a night time moisturizer Its way too heavy to go well under make up even with my dry skin I use it with their Phoenix oil and their Rose\\nread more Ive been shopping around for moisturizers and have found this to be one of my favorites that Ive tried I live in a high desert climate so its particularly difficult to keep my skin moist but this does it and I daresay makes it glow Very happy with this cream A great moisturizer for dry skin The small spoon allows you to use a little at a time but a little goes a long way Lasted me for months I absolutely love this moisturizer It hydrates my skin Love love love this moisturizer Ive never gotten so many compliments on my skin It just glows Switched from Freshs lotus complex 7 which I loved because they arent crueltyfree I didnt miss a beat with Pink Cloud it is full of antioxidants that I feel when I applylike a slight hot burn which was why I liked Fresh Scent is of roseslove it This is my moisturizer for winter I mix it with their orchid oil this is my second time buying it and I couldnt be happier Its lightweight yet rich smells amazing and its pretty on your counter you can tell the difference after using for a week my face looks less dull I love it Its lightweight leaves my skin feeling hydrated It feels like my skin took a chug of water I love this travel size of CT Magic Cream  The best moisturizer and primer for foundation  I have wanted to try this product ever since I learned about Charlotte Tilburys company magic cream is truly magic this lasted a 7 day vacation and came home with the jar not empty when you want to treat yourself go charlotte tilbury even the packing is fabulous Heard from friend about its magic Moistures perfectly and little devilish glow is the perfect Tried a little bit on my face and was extremely pleasant feeling Going to try for a while and will write full review Loving how rich smooth and creamy the texture of this cream feels The nice texture made it easier to blend into my skin It doesnt leave a greasy residue at all Its thick so you dont have to use much It soaks in real well so it doesnt interfere with my foundation and I love the hydration The fragrance is heavy and unnecessary My skin feels great after using this It is definitely a moisturizer and primer in one for my normal skin It is a splurge item for me and im not sure if I want to pay that much again when I have so many other products that I would like to try that are less money per ounce I couldnt love this cream more All I can say is it makes my skin feel so happy and balanced Initially I thought it would be thick based on how it comes out of the jar but it absorbs into skin within minutes I wear it morning and night It serves as a perfect base to prime my face for makeup Ive always had issues with hormonal breakouts and while I wont credit this cream with fixing everything I think its been a combination of products this has definitely helped I really believe it balances and calms my skin It makes it look radiant and feel great Ive been using it for about a month straight now and have noticed my skin become more even toned and hasnt broken out at all\\nread more This cream is amazing Tightens my face and makes me look younger Its not oily so it gives you an immediate freshened look without looking shiny Its amazing Ive been using for 1month and see the difference I shared this with La Mer as well they deserve full credit I have a scar near the right corner of my upper lip the result of an assault when I was 17 I took a blow across the mouth that opened a gash right through the full thickness of my lip and Ive lived with it for over 40 years About two months ago I picked up a jar of Gel de La Mer from Sephora tyvm VIB Rouge and have been using it as directed every day Not only is my face smooth and hydrated the scar is now softer smoother much lighter and much less noticeable Im happy to show beforeafter pics to give you an idea of the difference this product has made the pic of me in the gray sweater is from 12112017 the one in the black fleece was taken 1132020\\nread more I have sensitive skin and rosacea and I use this cream nightly to just sooth my skin and its great for that I had a reaction to a face mask one night and my rosacea flared up and started burning I applied this several times and the reaction went down almost immediately Im also acne prone and the gel version has never caused me to breakout I dont like the prices of the La Mer products or how strong their fragrance is but it has been a lifesaver for me many times Id recommend trying it or getting samples first if you can just because of the price and everyones skin is unique\\nread more Very soothing and hydrating Beautiful texture that really is cooling and hydrates instantly I love using this in the summer or when my skin is feeling red flushed or oily Amazing product Best cream to use if you have acne prone skin Not heavy but still moisturizes I really like this texture and its very hydrating There is probably an equally good product out there though but if you have the money get this Out of all the face creams I have used throughout my life this is by far my favorite and one that I can wear in the summer and the winter My face looks flawless when I use this stuff Ill be going back to this routine If you have oilyacne prone skinyou might wanna give it a try I use it at night as a night time moisturizer it really helps keep my skin hydrated while not being too oily It does not break me out either This is by far my favorite gel cream Will repurchase This is not for folks with normal skin that want a cooling effect in the summer You will not get the results you expect This moisturizer is meant for acne prone or oily skin that cant take heavy product in warmer climate With that being said Im one of the few that hated the original formula It literally did nothing for me so I just used the original in the winter and skipped La Mer in warmer weather bc my skin couldnt take it However this new formula works wonders and I can truly say it feels like the lighter equivalent of the original After just one use my skin is completely smooth the few bumps I had disappeared and my skin was so soft I couldnt stop touching it with the back of my hand of course There is a technique to using all La Mer moisturizers and the little spoon it comes with will help ensure you dont use too much at once I also only use as a night cream bc 1 you should be using a moisturizer with SPF in the day time and 2 you will get clogged skin if you use this under the sun\\nread more super cooling on the skin improved my skins texture and was not greasy or sticky i also loved the smell i can tell it has quality ingredients by how calming it is on my skin I had been using the old gel and was worried buying the new one last year due to the reviews This does not give any cooling effect which is good and hydrates me just the same  i am happy but there was no need to change it I had avoided getting this because of the negative reviews until I went to a La Mer counter and tried it for myself I am so glad that I did I love it as much as my Tatcha Water Cream and Belif Aqua Bomb These are the moisturizers I keep buying for daily use I have oily skin I swear you could fry an egg using all the oil I could produce Lol But seriously remember people everyone is different Just because it doesnt work for somebody doesnt mean it will be an epic failure for you too\\nread more There are a few products that I cannot be without and this moisturizer is one of them I received a deluxe sample of this and my oilysensitive skin has never looked better I have been using this product for almost a year and love how it gives my skin that fresh dewy appearance that Im after without causing breakouts The price tag is steep but a jlo glow makes it worth it for me  I dont understand the low ratings for this moisturizer It is absolutely amazing It has made my skin extremely soft and hydrated without feeling oily or sticky I have combination acne prone skin and so far this has not made me break out Also sephora should be giving out samples for La mer instead of customers buying and returning This is one La mer item I will be buying consistently Try it out I received this as a deluxe sample and was excited because I have always wanted to try La Mer products I LOVE this moisturizer It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and soft and I have found I dont even need to use a face primer before applying my foundation when I use this I have acneprone skin and this has not caused me to break out I use it very sparingly because a little is all you need and also because Im trying to make it last as long as possible because this product does not fit into my budget\\nread more This is the very best daily moisturizer Ive ever used and Ive tried so very many I actually quit using this about 2 years ago because it was expensive but recently I picked it up again I was looking at older photos noticed how much better my skin looked in them and decided I needed to go back to using this product Within three days of use I started getting compliments on my complexion again I will never stop using this again It leaves my skin glowing moisturized and soft\\nread more Feeling so rejuvenated when I apply this And I know it does miracles I always get compliments on looking youthful Totally recommend Was really impressed with this Most day creams with SPF are pretty greasy by nature but this one soaked

sunscreen I love this moisturizer for the day time It is super hydrating on my skin has SPF in it and smells really luxurious I notice immediate hydration and from daily use my skin has looked a lot more radiant moisturized and smooth This is my second purchase with this product Its very rich and moisturizing I noticed my skin is firmer and has a dewy glow after applying I love the bonus SPF 30 in it This is pretty pricey but I cannot part wit I tried other sunscreen products but nothing compares to the quality and moistness this product gives me When I tried to be frugal it backfired on me My chin dried out and it showed when I wore foundation Since returning to this product and using for 2 weeks consistently my face has returned back to normal No white cast whatsoever My skin is well hydrated Definitely a repurchase and cant live wo product for me\\nread more Im 42 and have been using this for 2 years now Its now the only serious day cream with SPF I use In my area SPF is a must and this cream lasts all day It makes my skin look creamy and bright and I with my dry skin I appreciate the thickness Bonus it smells nice and doesnt have that distinct sunscreen smell you get from other products Love this  After a week of using this product I noticed a healthy radiant look in my skin  Would purchase again Works great on my oily skin moisturizes without adding too much shine Great cream with SPFwouldnt be without it I absolutely love this moisturizer The scent is refreshing without being overpowering it hydrates super well and also creates a nice base for makeup A little goes a long way with this product I love messing around with skin products since my only concern is seasonal dryness and this moisturizer makes me feel softer than I ever have before The smell isnt too strong it makes me feel clean at night and awake in the morning Its totally worth any price I usually switch up moisturizers but I know Ill be returning back to this one Love this moisturizer

lovely and the feel of the product on your skin will give you mother nature status skin hydration The smell is so GOOD like nectar and a fresh garden It goes on so nice it makes me look so hydrated love this buying it again I loveeee this product Its my second time purchasing it the smell is amazing and the texture is not too heavenly not light Perfect for oily skin I love this moisturizer it definitely does the job of hydrating my face without leaving me oily or making my acne prone skin any worse I use it every morning even under primer and foundation Love love love Soothes your skin and smells glorious Was excited to try this because I love the glow water This did not disappoint Leaves the skin feeling moisturized and glowing This purchase counts my fourth jar of this moisturiser and I stock up another because of the discount I have used Rose Lotus and the Lotus night cream as well but this one is my favourite I am of combination skin and more on the dry side in winter and oily side in summer In winter I use it together with rose deep hydration toner and kombucha essence which helps my skin to stay moisturised without extra shine on my T zone In summer I use it together with Origins mushroom toner and this combination works fine for me as well It does bring certain glow to my skin but I have never used it alone thus I cannot say for sure that it works just fine on its own I would say its worth my penny \\nread more I have very sensitive skin and am always very hesitant to switch moisturizers since they stay on all night long and lock in my other face products But after using this moisturizer I am so glad I found it I used to switch moisturizers in the summer and winter But find that I can use this no matter the season because it is light enough for the summer and just enough for the winter I use this under my makeup and overnight and am so happy with how my skin feels immediately afterwards and in the morning It goes on beautifully I also love that there is not an obnoxious smell\\nread more This is an excellent product My skin is a combination kind of and I have been using this product for the last 5 months and still It has some left It helps to glow the skin to repair reduce visible spots it I bought another one I recommend this product I use it after my base makeup to melt it all together It holds it in place well and blends the cream and powder Got it in my Sephora Play box Love it buying it again It became part of my everyday routine 10h shift and I dont need to retouch my makeup This is my ride or die spray right here has been for years I use it before during and after makeup application for a flawless prime and set the mist is perfect and I can not go without it I purchased the mini travel size of the Photo Finish Primer Water impulsively as Id been out of setting spray and meaning to go to MAC for Fix  instead However after trying this as well as the other new setting spray by Smashbox  I have yet to purchase any other setting sprays This product is worth trying because in my opinion seems to actually DO what it claims and serves many more important purposes beyond just feeling refreshing and smelling nice This Primer Water I only used as a setting spray so I cant speak on how well it works as a primer used beneath foundation I feel this Primer Water version is incredible specifically for locking in makeup making it truly last all day while looking naturally radiant dewy  freshly done If youre like me and need something SERIOUSLY transferproof you may enjoy the Smashbox Photo Finish Setting Spray more Especially for those who work physically intensive jobs and need their makeup to LAST throughout sometimes sweaty work shifts That one is truly as transferproof as any form of makeup Ive tried thus far Especially considering Im one to blend my foundation powder etc into my neck  but unfortunately must wear black collared shirts for my job Before trying the Smashbox Setting Spray the inside of my shirt collar would be nearly white as snow compared to the black shirt within just minutes of putting it on Although a few  more than some other brands and smells feels and appears to be nothing more than water  its MAGIC I promise\\nread more My ultimate multi purpose spray I use it before and after putting on makeup I also wet my beauty blender with it to blend out foundation Helps create a nicely hydrated finish I have super dry skin so I carry a mini around to touch up I have repurchased this bottle 6 times so far in the last few years hoping they come out with a MEGA bottle so I can just refill my existing bottles with it I use this during the day if I want to touch up my foundation andor concealer I just spray and then go ahead and touch up this stuff is amazing definitely a must if you have dry  combination skin I use this to prep and to set and everything in between can never go without it The best primer there is It is so easy to apply and to use it as a setting spray as well I have been using this product for over five years It works This is the only setting spray that I have found that does not make my eyes water even though I close them tightly when I use any spray Works great I need to try it as a primer next Love that it is cruelty free too I have been loyal to this spray for the passed two years never do I let myself ran out of this Makes the world of difference with my dry skin Makes any foundation melt and looks flawless in my skin I love this product This was a huge upgrade from previous finishing sprays Ive used before like NYX Dewy Finish and Macs Fix Plus And was honestly hesitant to buy something higher than my usual price ranger for this type of product but I couldnt be happier with it it is 100 an investment though I also love that you can use it to prime and finish the lookbecause it is multipurpose it makes the purchase of it definitely twice as much worth Its lasted me a long time dont need a lot of product to get a good outcome Makes you level up your makeup game\\nread more Guys I didnt think I would love this product so much This is so great for dry skin girls it hydrates and helps my face feeling refreshed and happy I use

setting spray after I couldnt stand the Urban Decay setting spray smell any longer and I found the perfect product Doesnt have a strong scent and I love spraying it all over my skin Its now a musthave in my makeup routine Been using this for months now the only downside to it is the price but my skin got so used to it that I will continue buying it forever As much as I try to replace it with Belif or Clinique I end up coming back to this little guy I was looking a for a moisturizer for the winter time I was using a lot of products that kept leaving me oily This does NOT and I love it Thanks Springfield Mall VA for the recommendation Perfect for adding hydration without feeling greasy I have very sensitive but oily skin In the winter I can get some dry patches and my skin can look tired and lifeless This does the trick without breaking me out moisturizing those dry spots and its even helped to control some of the more oily areas I love the way it has left my skin feeling fresh plump and soft I dont really mind the fragrance and it doesnt seem to make my skin freak out I have been loving this cream\\nread more This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used I am on my early 30s and have always struggled with hormonal acne and clogged combination skin Fixing the right moisturizer to pair with acne treatments has always left my skin too greasy or not moisturizing enough

goes a long way so the 60 for 17 oz is totally worth it\\nread more Amazing moisturizer especially for my oily skin Its not sticky absorbed well and leaves my skin so hydrated I actually returned Murads hydrodynamic moisturizer after I received a sample of this and preferred it much more I didnt disliked the hydrodynamic but it didnt do much for me This on the other hand was so moisturizing

days than before I started using it Im happy I got the full size in this one\\nread more I didnt used to use a moisturizer but was told that it would help protect my skin It was a little expensive but

feeling greasy I use this before bed and let me tell you my skin looks and feels amazing in the morning This works as a superlightweight moisturizer substitute or used under your everyday moisturizer It feels great and does seem to make fine lines appear less defined A little goes a long way so even for the price it lasts several months for me Its become a solid addition to my skincare regimen this stuff seriously saved my skin i damaged my moisture barrier when i was trying to deal with my hormonal acne leaving my skin super dehydrated sensitive and bumpy I bought this and its helped cleared up SO much Id recommend as a night cream for oilycombo thats how i use it overall a great product and will be buying again I am never letting go of this product It claims to repair your barrier in 30m which I thought was an overexaggeration but its almost immediate Skin type I have sensitive skin dehydrated but not dry lacks water and will overcompensate by creating oil I live on things like Hyaluronic Fav lines are usually SR DE Truth I messed up my mantle with actives as the weather changed from warm to cold So everything I put on my face even the normal stuff felt like sunburn I reduced my routine to moisturizer only After days of this reduced routine I went to Sephora to look for a fix I tried a popular ceramide lotion and it felt like fire We wiped it off with micellar water Still on fire THEN we put this on my face and I was immediately relieved Every day since then has been more hydrated than the last The cystic acne that was developing in response to my broken barrier is now gone Bonus my wrinkles look reduced and my skin has a nice healthy glow No oil slick\\nread more I have tried moisturizer after moisturizer for my combination skin I am currently

effective as an essence in comparison Just finished my 5 oz bottle of this I swear by this product I use it by patting it into my dry skin with clean hands as my first step in my morning routine and after I use a sheet mask after I take a shower Since I moved to the east coast I struggled with extreme dry skin my skin would always flake and get eczema and my makeup would always look so caked and gross but now I never get flakey dry skin even in the winter Its also so great for sensitive skin like mine that also suffers from eczema I also like the watery consistency because it doesnt clog

moisturizer Ive even used I ran out of my old Clinique moisturizer and I wanted a change and omg I cant get over how my skin feels I went through a really dry patch before I got this  live in Canada

not greasy and has a delicate smell Quickly became my everyday moisturizer The only moisturizer with spf I will use This is my first review and Ive been using this for over 2 years It doesnt leave your face shiny like most other moisturizers with spf I change my skincare products a lot but this one is a staple that never changes Love this product Does not go heavy on the skin and has a nice fragrance This stuff actually works I have extremely sensitive dry acne prone and reactive skin I have a difficult time finding stuff that doesnt make my skin freak out This was effective and yet gentle enough to not agitate my skin My redness is fading and my skin looks brighter and clearer Im so impressed with this stuff I want to try other stuff from this line This is definitely a new staple in my cabinet Highly recommend this product It is the best oilfree moisturizer with SPF that I have found It is not greasy and it is easy to apply make up on top of this moisturizer I was a little hesitant because of the price but this product lasts a long time Give it a try Love this cream I developed dark spots from the sun on my face and most recumbent neck Ive been using this cream for a month and have noticed the the spots are getting lighter Need the SPF everyday Wonderful moisturizer This is such a gem product for the summer love how light it feels and how well it absorbs Perfect for combination skin Have been using it for a few years now with the vitamin C serum and see a great difference in my skin Cannot say how much I love this product I have been using this product for a long time I have rosacea and my skin usually reacts to even the gentlest of products For me this is perfect it doesnt irritate my skin it is nonoily and it has an SPF I also love its delicate hintoffruit scent It took me a while to find my moisturizer and I wont use anything else All time favorite moisturizer I notice less breakouts with it and more balanced skin This is a bomb product amazing This is a creamy thick lotion that goes on smooth and soaks in quickly to allow you to apply make up over I love this night cream My skin is firmer and baby soft A little goes a long way I know its on the pricey side but it lasts a long time and does not break me out So far Caudalie products have been good for my 41 yr old skin I love this product It moisturizes my skin so deeply without leaving it feeling oily or greasy and in the morning my skin is still soft and moisturized This is my go to night cream Its thick but not oily and I think my skin looks firmer I dont breakout Im 48 and think my skin looks pretty good The cream last a long time while the serum that goes with it seems to run out really fast So I sometimes use with other serums been using this for a month now love it not to heavy and does not leave my skin greasy the tone and texture of my skin has improved dramatically I am menopausal and have been searching for a product to help my skin look better and I think I found it wonderful recommendation from the store Love this product now that Im entering my 40s and this feels like my skin has become firmer and less dull Best night cream ever Its hydrating without feeling heavy Leaves my skin refreshed and feeling good The best night cream goes on smooth and doesnt feel heavy I had been using a different lift night serum Korres Black Pine 3D I was disappointed in that product so I turned to my favorite skin care brand Caudalie This cream is so cool soothing yet tingly and Im already seeing some results after 3 weeks It may be an expensive brand but Caudalie NEVER fails to work This lifting night cream is wonderful Smoothing tightening moisturizing My skin is over 50 but I dont look it due mainly to Caudalie\\nread more Love this When I wake up in the morning my complexion is beautiful and personally I love the smell I have mature skin and actually feel product tightening my face My favorite  I was first introduce to Caudalie skin care line when I was given a sample Im 62 yrs old and many think Im 40 due to my face is so smooth I now used Caudalie as my skin care Such a good night cream for winter and summer A fantastic night creme  it is very helpful for my neck as well as my face A subtle scent for nighttime sweet dreams I only use the night creme because its stronger than the day version but this creme makes time go backwards Its super rich but not in a heavy clogging your pores way more like it sinks into your skin Love this line Very creamy night replenisher  you see the difference in the morning  it sinks in perfectly I will never try anything else I have switched off in the past always looking for the holy grail This is it It leaves my skin so soft and radiant I have been using this cream for about 2 months by now and I absolutely love it I use it as a day cream at the moment because my skin gets very dry during the winter It absorbs quickly without leaving an oily residue It just feels good on my skin I am very sensitive to harsh chemicals in my skincare and I am pretty sure that this product doesnt have any because I didnt have any allergic reaction so far This was my first foray into oil cleansing and Im in love This oil removes all of my makeup mascara rinses away clean and leaves my skin feeling super soft I typically only use at night so one bottle lasted me six months This product is amazing It dissolves makeup and does not leave a greasy residue I would highly recommend it I have very dry skin and this does a great job at removing makeup Good cleansing oil As a guy I only really use it to properly take several days of my SPF off Gentle does cause a little cloudy vision the few times Ive gotten it my eye My sensitive combo skin prefers this over Green Clean which i found to strip my skin during double cleansing Again I wont use as much as someone with make up but should last 4 months at least with daily use I LOVE this brand  that its clean what it stands for and how it sources its ingredients I tried this on a gut feeling after a different brand cleansing remover didnt work out as Id hoped The true test would be if it would be effective on my waterproof mascara I often use the pads of my fingers to apply cleansing oil and all my eye makeup  primer shadow waterproof gel eyeliner and most of my waterproof mascara went off within the first swipe Passing the pads of my fingers over my lashline twice over after that and the rest of the mascara was gone It was so quick and effective the rest could be used to cleanse the rest of my face So it turns out I dont need much per makeup removal very economical Wash off with water clean as a whistle I double cleanse but I couldve been good as is Second thing I was concerned about was breaking out afterwards since my skin is HIGHLY sensitive and prone to breaking out ZERO breakouts I found my Holy Grail cleansing oil\\nread more This is definately a keeper I use this in the morning especially in the winter when my skin is on the drier side I have also used it at night to remove my makeup and it does a fabulous job It removes my waterproof mascara easily This cleanser is very gentle and leaves my skin feeling soft and plump The only drawback is because its not very thick in consistency since its an oil I lose some of the product as I rub it between my hands and go to apply it to my skin\\nread more This stuff will make you believe in the power of a doublecleanse I use this with my Cera Ve foaming cleanser and my skin feels so clean but not at all dry afterwards Smells fantastic too A must buy The living best

moisturizer for awhile now and Ive found it to be perfect in winter or summer Im an oily skin type fair slight redness and this does the trick if you like lightweight There isnt really a smell either So I think its decent for sensitive types I absolutely love this gelcream moisturizer My dry zones on my face have disappeared and I love how fast this soaks in After trying out multiple moisturizers I stumbled upon this one and have just repurchased my second refill I highly recommend if youre looking for something lightweight and effective Not at all greasy Dries without leaving my face dry The best thing is that a little goes a long way This is my favourite moisturizer My skin is very oily and I have avoided moisturizing until I found this one Ive been using it for 2 years and tried a few other gel moisturizers but none were as good as this one love it for combination to oily skin it absorbs really quickly its similar to the belief aqua bomb By far my favorite Kiehls moisturizer I have oily skin and this formula works perfectly to hydrate my skin at night after applying topically treatments Easily absorbed and my new favorite nightly moisturizer So lightweight this gelcream feels like a cloud on your face Nongreasy and absorbs well I use this as a summer moisturizer as my skin usually gets particularly oily in the summer months My skin loves this and is so much more matte Honestly I bought this product because the ultra facial cream was sold out I have oily skin so I figured why not try a gel moisturizer Id never heard of it before I LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER A little goes a long way it rubs in so creamy but then dries completely matte I use it before bed to give my skin a break from SPF overnight Definitely worth it Great moisturizer for all skin types Been using this for years and I love it Ive gone from normaldry skin to oilyacneprone skin back to normal skin after accutane and Ive used this throughout all the types Its light but very hydrating perfect for the summer It leaves my skin hydrated plump and soft Absolutely no greasy residue and works great for the dry patches I get sometimes on my cheeks If you like water creams but want more moisturehydration

my bumpy dry skin within 4 days This product is amazing highly recommend It does exactly what it says hydrates the skin and makes it feel fresh It absorbs quickly I use it after I wash my face before bed and after I wake up Not disappointed Lightweight and absorbs quickly and doesnt make me more oily Ive been using this for YEARS Even though they recommend using before moisturizer I use after as a last step before SPF When I use this before my moisturizer doesnt soak in as well so this works best for me to lock everything in I use it in the morning but in the past have used it twice a day Im fairly dry and can tell if I dont use this daily It helps with texture sometimes I use it in my hair Love it under makeup Cant go without it Only downside is they used to sell a small trial type size which is how I got hooked on it Wish they still did so people could see the benefits plus it was perfect for travel\\nread more One of the staples in my beauty bag Initially when I first bought this someone told me it has a distinct smell that you either love or hate I guess I love it I wish that I had discovered this sooner as I have very dry sensitive skin This oil along with the Vitamin Nectar serum are a dynamic duo for my skin My skin is even toned now smooth supple and radiant I will definitely repurchase I have a combination dry and oily skin My only problem is dry skin around my mouth and between by brows I found this face oil that works Finally a product that smells delicious and feels clean I love this so much I highly recommend this to everyone Try it out Great product I put it on after my moisturizer at night and I wake up with very soft hydrated skin This oil is the best One or two drops is all you need You can either layer it or combine with your moisturizer for a little bit of a boost When I use this I notice my skin is smooth and has more elasticity and feels and looks supple Hydration at its best for a healthy appearance I will definitely buy again and highly recommend to anyone This oil is the best It moisturizes without being greasy made my dry red sensitive skin absolutely glow even during a ski trip to Colorado Love this I use it on my face nails and hair and my TODDLERS hair skin and nails too The smell is magic I wish my whole house smelled like this Only complaint is that it is not sold by the gallon I use this product morning and night When I get out of the shower or wash my face This is the next step after toner It smells divine with a natural fragrance Whatever I have left from application I rub down to my chest and tops of my shoulders My only complaint is its price because I use it so much I have the driest of dry skin All year long my face basically a desert This stuff has been SUCH a game changer for me I have used every oil under the sun and i swear nothing moisturizes and nourishes my skin as well as this does Anytime I try out a different oil i miss this one I put a thin layer on my at night before moisturizer and wake up with moisturized and plump skin A lot of reviews mention how horrible the smell is but I actually really really like it It smells super relaxing and spa like to me which makes the entire experience of using this oil feel super luxurious I would suggest smelling it in store or getting a sample before getting a full sized because it seems to be a scent you either love or hate But scent aside this oil is amazing and definitely a holy grail for me\\nread more Amazing value Had been using Vintners daughter but was tired of paying 180 This oil is a true competitor at half the price Using this oil

recommended this to me since Im am allergic to many synthetic fragrances and this has 100 natural fragrance Ive been patting three drops into my skin morning and night and I swear it has started fading my hyperpigmentation while fighting my breakouts even when my hormonal acne tried to flare up My skin still isnt perfect but its hydrated without being oily my scars are fading Ive had less

Dr Youngs youtube channel and decided to give this ingredients a try Start using this product 7 days after my morpheus 8 treatment for only my evening routine and my skin was instant healing and smoother I was told it took up to 3 months to show the result but the result was noticeable for me Now I also pair this product with Clarisonic massager which I think its really helpful for the absorbent Cant wait to start using Dr Dennis vitamin C Collagen for my morning routine The only downside of this cream is that it may not be hydrated enough where I would use a drop of facial oil before applying this cream Anyways I gave it 5 starts and recommend other ladies who has mature skin to try it on\\nread more Purchased this in store without really knowing the brand heard good things but took the leap WORTH EVERY PENNY Feels amazing on the skin hydraes like no other and doesnt make me break out My absolute favorite face moisturizer I am a 70 yearold with fair skin Lately my skin grew tired of my regular regimen and along with some sleepless nights and timezone changes became sallow and bumpy This product went right to work The results were so good that my bold neighbors came over to try it After scooping out little bits for many people I now need to reorder I highly recommend this product Loved this Felt very light and moisturizing Will repurchase Cant give enough stars LOVE Wont be going back to my old skin care line thats for sure  trust me it wasnt a cheap one   by far this moisturizer and Dr Dennis Gross skincare products are exceptionally made to keep skin healthy glowing and young Your skin will thank you and you wont be disappointed I have only had this product for about 2 weeks and I already see a huge difference I use the brightening serum before I use this and it is crazy how much it works I am 32 yrs and I noticed there were a few wrinkle lines on my forehead between my eyebrows and where I smile I wanted to get a head start on my skin care game and make sure my skin is fully hydrated before I begin to age anymore It has been 2 weeks and the lines have completely disappeared My skin feels very hydrated and also my pores have gotten smaller My skin feels great I barely need makeup but when I do wear make up it goes on so smoothly and looks great Very happy with this product FYI my skin is combo\\nread more Only used it for two weeks and my skin was in the best condition Moisturizing enough for winter and felt really nice after application Ok Im a believer I was a bit skeptical whether this would help reduce the appearance of my fine lines but after a couple weeks my skin was noticeable younger looking and oh so soft I admittedly purchased a different face cream to try after finishing this one which was a huge mistake I ended up purchasing this again before I even finished the other Love love love Had a sample in a store and have been using for three days I see some improvements in my skin in the morning The skin is more glowing and no red color around my nose But i am using it after applying alfa beta pads So im not sure what works cream pad or combination Anyways i love result I returned to using this moisturizer after trying another one I didnt like the way my skin felt when I used the other moisturizer so returned to this one I have problem skin Meaning I break out have large pores and get red and irritated really easily This did not break me out and made my skin feel WONDERFUL For being just a nightly moisturizer and not an actual peel I feel this deserves the high ratings I love how this moisturizes and smooths my skin Smells great and goes well under makeup I purchased this after the eye serum and I use it mainly at night It has made such a difference in my skins appearance and texture  it is amazing I have been using it for 6 weeks and am seeing the difference The product also lasts a long time because a little goes a long way  definitely worth the money Love after just one use my skin feels soft as a babys bottom Im normally really dry this hydrates and gives me a little plump Ive had numerous people ask what Ive done to my skin Ive heard a lot of grumbling that this is just the same as the coconut oil in the grocery store I have to disagree I tried the Kopari on one leg and the grocery store organic on the other and the Kopari seemed to sink into the skin while still leaving a glossy protective film The grocery store oil sat on top of my skin was quite oily and didnt seem to sink in and hydrate like the Kopari I wish this wasnt the case because I would prefer to pay 5 bucks instead of 37 but I have to be honest and fair in what my experience was Im buying the large size of the Kopari I have desert dry skin that literally cracks in the winter and is very painful Hope this is helpful Oh yes and no annoying fragrance just a delicate coconut smell from the ingredient I think this is a love for me\\nread more You only need the smallest amount at night to notice a huge difference I dont recommend using this as a makeup remover if thats what people are using it for I received this as a sample and used it as a moisturizer and its amazing My face

four of the large containers and got this mini for my three week back packing trip its a great size and this stuff is soooo much better than regular lotion My skin texture has significantly improve by using this in place of lotion My skin feels truly hydrated from using this product Best coconut oil Ive ever used It serves multiple purposes and a little goes a long way so it lasts a decent amount of time considering how often I use it My 2yearold son and I both have eczema dry itchy skin with some scaly patches and this works wonderfully to soothe itchiness and redness I slather it on my legs before jumping in the shower so that it had time to warm up while washing my hair etc then add shaving cream over it to shave my legs and it has stopped the razor burn  itchy dry feeling I always get after shaving I add a dollop to a hot bath and use it as a bath oil I use it after showering for my entire body Looks beautiful on the skin in the summertime tames flyaways on my hair and is fast

now Soft yet firm and a slight glow Its my holy grail I purchased this from the help of a Sephora skincare expert I was telling her how I am combo and my tzone always looks greasy and I know its my oils coming through becauSe I do not drink enough water and my skin is dehydrating So she shows me this brand and I must say after a few a days of trying this along with using the universal 2 step pads I have seen such a difference I skin has less texture and boosted my hydration At first I got worried because a lot of reviews say it broke them out But I havent not broken out or anything after

since Ive been using it friends have commented that my skin has been glowing When I went for a recent and routine medical test the nurse looked at my chart looked at me and said Girl You look goooood This has easily taken five years off the look of my skin and its worth every penny Im going to mention the scent of this oil because I was concerned with it before I bought it and its not mentioned anywhere that I could find I found a sample so I could try it out first Because theres tamanu oil I thought that the scent would be nutty I hate the scent of tamanu oil It also mentions sunflower oil and ginger so I was like is it spicy it something However the Daily Reviving Concentrate is pleasantly citrus scented Id say its mostly lemony No trace of peanut butter or related foods The oil has a similar effect as the Midnight Recovery Concentrate I expect you could probably use either one at any time during the day dont quote me on that There are some oils in both that Ive read can create damage when exposed to sun so if its concerning to you Id recommend looking that up This oil mentions that it prevents damage from the sun so maybe it cancels itself out I dont know I also need to educate myself on which order to use this with sunscreen All that said I love this almost as much as the Midnight Recovery Concentrate which is to say A LOT MRC is in my top 5 beauty products Excited

improve your skin THIS IS THE ONE Kiehls can take all of my money I use this in the morning and the midnight recovery oil at night  my skin has never looked better The natural glow from this in the morning is REAL This oil is amazing if you wear a full face of makeup It does not interfere with anything while leaving your skin hydrated and awakened in the morning Beautifully brightening and smells so fresh This is a lightweight oil with a delicate citrus scent perfect for starting the day off in a good mood 3 or 4 drops are all you need before your moisturizer and SPF It absorbs into my skin nicely and is perfectly luxurious when combined with a little facial massage Leaves the skin brightened moisturized and luminous I definitely recommend this one The bottle is huge so itll last

brightened moisturized and luminous I definitely recommend this one The bottle is huge so itll last forever skin changing product I began using this about 2 years ago alongside the Midnight Recovery Concentrate I am on my second bottle I love this product I have oily skin with the occasional dry patches This doesnt leave my skin oily or sticky but rather restores moisture and hydration and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth I never break out or experience any irritations Also a little goes a long way I tried the Kielhs Midnight recovery concentrate and love it so I wanted to try this for during the day and Im so happy I did I have extremely dry and irritated skin and this just helped so much I also feel like it helped with the smoothness of my skin I definitely recommend this for people with dry skin I apply a couple drops to the palms of my hands and pat it on my skin after applying my moisturizer Seriously love this My skin feels so soft Not greasy and easily absorbed I use it in the morning and skin feels great and moisturizer even in the winter temperatures I used this every morning and the bottle lasted me almost one year I used other products while using this oil so Im not sure how much I can attribute to the oil alone Some products cause me to break out but this oil did not It did not leave me oily and my skin seemed to absorb it pretty quickly I usually waited about 3 minutes before applying sunscreen and makeup Im a face oil fanatic and there are so many others that I want to try but I will definitely purchase this one again It is an AMAZING value especially considering how long it lasted\\nread more I have combination skin and in the summer my skin is oily but in the winter my face is super dry this moisturizer does not make my skin feel oily at all and it absorbs so quickly I know numerous people dont like the smell and Im normally sensitive to them but I honestly do not mind the scent at all Will continue to keep buying as its my go to moisturizer AMAZING I have sampled this a couple of times to make sure that I wanted to spend the money on this So worth it Makes my combination skin so soft and a little goes a long way My skin is mostly dry but I have some Tzone oiliness This works perfectly Also has a very light but pleasantly fresh scent I LOVE this This product is incredible for my combination skin its hydrating but not too oily or sticky I love this version of their cream Lighter for summer but still very moisturizing Not really a gel This moisturizer has evened out my combination skin Im no longer getting the oil slick in my Tzone It also sufficiently moisturizes the rest of my face Probably not great for dry skin Ill also mention the packaging to this product is very bizarre I feel like Im opening a bank vault in an Oceans 11 movie every time I use it Often imitated but never duplicated Been using hydragel almost 20yrs when i can afford it Whenever i have went astray my skin suffers And although its oilfree and geared towards oily complexion i have slightly combo hut more dry sensitive prone skin no acne yet this leaves me dewy plump hydrated I cant believe how many brands are out there now that feel like this at first but dont even come close in performance Dont be duped Your money is well spent here and the jar lasts quite a while For a few years I stopped using because I was fear mongered by another brand owner Paula because of fragrance and alcohol but then my skin became so drab and dull Once I went back to this brand  dewy youthful glow is back and Im 40 now I often get compliments and get asked advice and people think Im in my 20s  that speaks to this skincare\\nread more My absolute favorite moisturizer Worth every penny Great for oilycombination skin Fresh scent is a bonus I love this product Its really what it says Hydrating cream gel with oil free I apply 2 times a day when at home and at least one time in morning before any kind of makeup This cream is like awesome I was using La Mer for about a year and decided it just wasnt working for me So I went into the store and was recommended this product by one of the salespeople She said that when clients come in looking for something similar to La Mer without such a high price point she always recommends the AMOREPACIFIC brand I am so glad I listened to her because she was spot on This moisturizer is light but hydrating It smells lovely but its not over powering I have oily skin and I felt like the La Mer sometimes would just sit on my skin This stuff absorbs so well and once it sets in it doesnt leave my face feeling greasy So I love the product and its also way less expensive than what I was using before Win win I would definitely recommend\\nread more I love this stuff and am almost sad to say that due to how expensive its is but it really works like a charm A little bit goes a long way as others have mentioned so much so that if you use too much product it will not easily absorb into the skin and is why I think a few people had issues with it leaving the skin tacky Ive never felt that way with this product however A pea sized amount or less will cover the entire face Thank goodness because that really helps it to last longer I have generally dry skin but get slightly oily on my nose and on my lower brow near the bridge of my nose This helps my skin stay hydrated and soft all day and is perfect under my makeup\\nread more my skin has never looked better shoutout to the Sephora rep who recommended this this product is perfect to combat dry skin and does not leave skin dewy or oily by midday I have had very acne prone skin with breakouts since I was a teenager and I actually think this has helped to really clear it up it looks great well worth the price tag I got a sample of this from Sephora and literally fell in love I have the most oily skin of anyone I know It is literally like an oil slick after an hour no matter how much oil control setting spray or foundation I use I have tried every single oil control moisturizerhydratorserum out there This is by far the best I hate paying 100 for a moisturizer but I promise it is worth it To say that I like this moisturizer would be an understatement I absolutely adore how fast it absorbs and how it leaves no stickiness behind while heavenly moisturizing It uses less water than similar products in its composition but a higher bamboo extract concentration While it may seem pricey it is well worth it One of my holy grails So lovely Feels wonderful on your skin smells fresh Pricey for sure but worth it Ive spent the past 18 months looking for the perfect moisturizer and I FINALLY FOUND IT Before I get started heres what I tried before I found this amazing product Lush Vanishing Cream Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Moisturizer Kate Somerville ExfoliKate Glow Moisturizer The Lancer Method Nourish tried both the original and the blemish control and Tatcha Water Cream this was my secondfave I have sensitive combination skin that gets oily in my tzone and dry around the edges of my face A Sephora employee recommended I try the Amorepacific moisture bound hydragel and it has changed my skin I no longer get dry anywhere and it has helped reduce the oil in my tzone My skin tone is more even and my skin looks brighter I use this moisturizer day and night and it lasts me about two months I absolutely LOVE this product and am so so glad I found it I also went through cleansers with each of the above brands and the Amorepacific Treatment Cleansing Foam is a DREAM and Ill leave a separate review for that If youre looking for a new skincare routine I cannot recommend this line enough\\nread more Is this really worth a hundred dollars YES I first tried this as a sample and it was so smooth and so soft It just melts into my skin In the springfall months it is PERFECT for me In the winter I need something slightly heavier but in the other three seasons this is ideal My skin gets oily with too heavy products or sometimes gets red or irritated and occasionally can even break out But with this fabulous product my sensitive skin behaves and feels silky and the fine lines are minimizing at the same time The fragrance is soft and fresh when you first apply it but it goes away within minutes of application I wouldnt recommend a high priced product to other Sephora beauties if I didnt strongly believe in it but this one is the real deal Its a game changer By the way Im buying a new full sized jar today\\nread more Best moisturizer I bought Yes it is on the higher end of things BUT I decided to splurge and give it a try and Im really glad I did because it has truly transformed my skin During the summer my skin went from dry to early and now after using it daily my skin is back to normal and its great LOVE IT Hydrates your skin really well for makeup application Makeup lays nicely on top of it and doesnt pill This is a dry girls must have Although if you are looking for pore filling I would pair this with a primer that is specifically meant for pores as this product doesnt offer much of that This product is a good primer I have dry aging skin and it really does help moisturize and my skin DOES feel smooth and ready for makeup after applying Ive had this product for a while But I didnt know how good it is until recently Ive been looking for moisturizer that works with my skin But I didnt find any Ive only always use this under foundation However recently I started using it as moisturizer when I dont want to wear foundation It is great I can tell the difference when I wear this as the moisturizer and when I dont have it on as moisturizer It makes my skin smoother and softer\\nread more good 2 in 1 primer for everyday use 1 pump goes a long way This primer is the JAM It makes me look hydrated without looking oily You cannot go wrong wit this item I never look cakey when wearing this I have dry sensitive aging skin and have a hard time finding Primers that help with age lines I am so happy with this purchase Its light moisturising and plumps my laugh lines Im extremely impressed with how this primer does so many things My makeup lasts 12 hours looks beautiful I

makes my makeup look good and lasts most of the day at work One of my fav primers Some primers just feel too matte if that makes sense or that silicone puddy feeling This makes me feel like Im actually moisturizing and prepping my skin correctly Not heavy Doesnt break me out Does the job One of the best primers out there I use this under different types of foundations to keep a hydrated healthy skin look I have extremely dry skin and have searched for a primer that will keep my makeup looking natural all day and this is the only one that works for me I normally hate smashbox primers and generally feel like all primers Ive tried drugstore and high end are kinda useless My skin is on the dry side so its hard to get a nice smooth canvas I actually felt like this product did the job of a primer though It definitely helped for the moisture aspect and my skin DOES feel smooth and ready for makeup after applying Im so dry that ive been refusing to use powder in my makeup routine but now that I use this primer I find I can use powder to set my makeup and not look crusty No complaints about this product\\nread more I love that this is a primer and moisturizer in one It has a lotion texture It doesnt feel heavy or greasy I love it still my all time fav  cant buy enough Love it in the morning before full makeup but have used in before I sleep I have never really been into primer and with dry acneprone skin it was something that I often avoided But after using a sample size of this primer I bought the larger size and have not regretted my purchase in the least It helps a lot with keeping foundation coverage looking even and helps me to use less of my foundation Also it does not make my skin drier and does not break me out I have sensitive eyes as wells and while I do not use this primer on the skin below my eyes it does not seem to irritate the area around my eyes like some other skincare products do\\nread more One of the best primers if you have dry skin I use two pumps and then apply foundation and it stays strong all day Ive always had a hard time remembering to use primer but this stuff makes my skin feel so hydrated that I never forget to apply it Holy

apparent I LOVE this product I really really really wish I didnt love this essence But I knew after using it just a few times that it would always have a place on my skincare shelf Its a very simple formation  only a few clean ingredients  which my hypersensitive acneprone skin really appreciates The main star of this product is fermented green tea It nourishes hydrates and heals the skin extremely well If you find yourself in the midst of an overexfoliation crisis been there or a bad breakout me every month from being an idiot who tries too many products you need this I highly suggest keeping your routine simple and just using a gentle cleanser this essence and a dab of moisturizer Then watch your skin thrive I also want to add that I have tried basically all of the holy grail essences SKII Tatcha Missha Neogen Primera etc Amore Pacific is the allround winner for me Just wish it wasnt so expensive \\nread more I LOVE this stuff I received a deluxe sample from Amore Pacific and my skin was transformed I dont know what it did but when I ran out and stopped using it my acne returned Its expensive but a little goes a long way Ive purchased my first full size bottle and its worth the splurge Simple product with great quality Really enjoy using this essence First thing I start with after cleansing Absorbs quickly Ive noticed my skins redness has improved using this Like that it doesnt have many ingredients and serves its purpose I tried this and at first I didnt notice anything I felt like I was just putting water on my face I gave it 2 wks and wow you will just start to look better I dont know how to describe it When I dont use it my face doesnt look as vibrant and alive Expensive but worth it Love love Am a kombucha fan so I was excited to see this product I am using lots of acids to help with melasma My skin is very tight and nothing had helped I tried this after a facial and my skin felt so much better This am no dryness Already my skin feels better Am a true believer I initially received this as a sample from an Allure Beauty Box At the time I wasnt really taking care of my skin  just using a regular facial cleanser and thats it My skin wasnt in very good shape With all this I used the product and saw pretty immediate results the next day and even more results with each day Think Are you wearing makeup  someone asking you because your skin looks so good that you must be wearing makeup but one cant really tell if you are I splurged and bought the full sized product A little goes a REALLY LONG WAY so this should last you close to or up to a year or so I use it morning and night I would add this at the very minimum to my skincare routine if nothing else This is the first and one of the only products I have ever used that have wowed me to the point that I very highly recommend it to anyone Ive recommended it to family and my hairdresser colorist and so forth I bought the largest size\\nread more I have sensitive and dry skin which breaks me out easily especially when comes to the Winter season or Seasonchanged time I found this product by accident when I was looking for Sulwhasoo  the other Kbeauty brand in Korean the association recommends it I strongly recommend u to try even if it is a little bit expensive but definitely desire the money I dont know how this product works I dont really know what its supposed to do I do know that that when I stop using it my skin is dull drab breaks out and generally looks blah Since Ive used it consistently my skin is luminous plump pimple free with reduced hyperpigmentation and acne scarring AGAIN I dont know howwhatwhy but this stuff will never leave my skin care rotation My skin is extremely sensitive acne prone with fine lines and scars easily I pat it on clean dry skin and follow with serum then moisturizer Im on my 2nd bottle Pricey but worth it\\nread more holy grail this is amazing and worth every penny not sure why its not clean at sephora but i checked every ingredient against EWG and it is clean This product is amazing Totally worth the price  cleared up my skin and left it looking hydrated and even My all time favorite essence I use this for my daytime routine with or without makeup It makes a marked improvement in my skins texture All the hype is true I love this product so much and my skin has never felt better  This toner is a bit pricey but is so gentle and amazing Its very soothing on my sensitive skin and I prefer it to SKII pitera essence which is also great but smells a bit unpleasant I also used this on my face after a sunburn I could not keep up with the Berduma sun even with constant SPF application and I didnt even peel It definitely helped to restore my skin I love AmorePacific products and this essence is no exception I use 34 drops after cleansing morning and night and it leaves my skin looking and feeling so smooth  even before moisturizing Its expensive but my first bottle lasted me almost eight months Its a wonderful product that will definitely remain a part of my daily regimen I love love love it Ive used many different brands of toners from expensive to inexpensive and this is by far the best one I have used Within a week my face has shown clarity and its only getting better day by day Saves my skin from drying out and reduces redness I use it at night before my acne retinol creme It really helps me from waking up with irritated skin I noticed a difference when I stopped using it daily when I forgot it on a trip I dont use a cotton pad and the bottle has lasted me a very long time I might buy the smaller size next time I received this in my boxy charm and absolutely loved it Bought another in the addon store This moisturizer soaks right into my skin and doesnt leave me feeling sticky or greasy It has absolutely ZERO scent too Ive tried entirely too many moisturizers and Ive finally found the perfect one for me This seems like more of a product for oily skin as its water based and very lightweight I do like how it as a morning moisturizer under my makeup though Very smoothing and spreads easily on my face It plumps my skin before my makeup without being too heavy or oily and breaking up my foundation This is perfect if you have dry skin before makeup and want something lightweight or want to achieve the trendy dewy look\\nread more Absolute PERFECTION Combatted the dry Canadian winter that my previous moisturizer was really struggling with Helps to pat it on like the package says This is my baby Not a strong scent good coverage for a small amount and non greasy It soaks into my skin and makes it so soft Received a full size in my Boxycharm box and wow I didnt expect much since most moisturizers are a disappointment However for someone with oily skin this gave me the perfect amount of moisture without leaving me feeling greasy If you feel sticky try using less and rub it a little bit longer on your face I will repurchase after my current one runs out Love the hydration this packs Goes on thick and melts into the skin so well Skin is feels supple after use This goes on so smooth and though its thick it doesnt leave your skin feeling cakey or weighed down I like to apply this and then use my jade roller at night for a perfect calming effect I didnt like this product at first I felt like it stayed very tacky after I applied it I started using a bit less and rubbing it in on circular motions a bit longer That made a huge difference It dries down isnt tacky and honestly its BEST moisturizer to use under make up My make up looks flawless now and honestly I wouldnt use anything else after getting use to this This jar is going to last me FOREVER because really you only need to use a very small amount I just dip the tip of my finger in and use just enough to cover my face it spreads easily and sinks in almost immediately I have noticed that if I use too much it does feel sticky and I recon thats what is going on with those who have complained of the feel Most importantly it doesnt make me break out Its the only moisturizer in my cabinet that doesnt make me super oily I have a collection of moisturizers that Ive tried but cant use for this reason\\nread more I hated it the first few times I used it it made my skin feel hydrated but was really sticky and heavy BUT now 2ish weeks later Im in love with it My skin has changed completely it used to be dry and rough and now its sooo smooth and soft my skin has never done this Its like glass Its really hydrating and I feel like my pores have reduced in size too My makeup has a flawless finish whenever I use this underneath  primer Highly recommend\\nread more love this concealer covers dark circles looks natural Wish it came with a foam pad to apply I would definitely recommend this Finished 2 cases of this and ordered the third one too This was initially recommended by one of the Sephora artist when i have told her my problem areas I use this to cover my in grown hair on my jawline and chin and this perfectly does the job with no grease and leaving the face with a fine texture I use this underneath my concealer and it does help cover up my dark circles Its very light in consistently and doesnt crease I wouldnt say this is my favorite product even though it does its job I like the Becca corrector slightly better because of the brightening If you want a corrector this would be a good first product to try This is sooooo soooo good It has completely surpassed and replaced my Becca corrector Smooth natural not too emollient or shiny for my aging undereye area correcting and brightening and most importantly it does not crease if you set it properly I highly highly recommend this product for anyone who has been struggling with dark circles puffiness andor that tired eye look  I love it so much that I want to buy a backup just in case I misplace this one\\nread more Love This product is a staple for me I use it with or without makeup it helps brighten my whole face and you use a tiny tiny bit for each eye Its crazy the difference it makes I have sunken in under eye bags that always cast blue and purple due to my under eyes being this way every concealer or corrector Ive used either creased badly wasnt bright enough very thick or let the blue hues come through This product has changed my whole under eye problem for the better My under eyes never looked as bright and well rested This product doesnt crease on me and the shade works great on its own I dont apply concealer on top of this as it works well for me A little goes a long way I used this product with the Laura Mercier Under eye brightening powder in my routine everyday and could not be happier with how my eyes look\\nread more A corrector that conceals the dark circles and doesnt cake or crease I used glossiers concealer over it and it worked perfectly This is a great product Covers and blends beautifully Looks natural No creasing or settling into fine lines It seems like a very small amount of product but a little goes a very long way However it definitely needs to be set with powder as it can be a little sticky if its not Love this stuff A little goes a long way Put this under my eyes and then I will had some concealer and good bye panda eyes This is one of the best color correctors I alternate between this and the Bobbie Brown corrector This brightens up my undereyes and it doesnt leave my undereye area dry and crepey I do have to set it since it is a creamy formula but it works great I absolutely love this product It is tacky and stays in place all day I have some pretty dark circles that concealer was not enough for this doesnt cake or make fine lines look any more obvious You know when you just know this is the one Ive used this once and it brightened everything up without looking like I just covered my under eyes with concealer I didnt even need to layer concealer over top Im in love It also doesnt cling or exacerbate dry spots  5 start product This will be a staple Brush application instead of a sponge really makes the difference here Just the lightest brush application followed by a finishing powder of choice makes all the difference between 1 longevity of the product throughout the day and 2 longevity of the product overall before needing a refill The texture is a little balmytacky at first but just blend out and let dry or set with finishing powder Less is more here\\nread more Amazing covers my under eyes like a dream I got it because of Allanas video so happy i did Brightens my undereye areas and is a great primer for eyeshadows Love this corrector Oftentimes its the only face makeup product I use It always looks flawless and makes me look awake The product doesnt crease or dry out my eye area A little goes a long way with this product I apply it with a damp beauty blender and this I find to be the best way to melt the product into the skin not fingers surprisingly this item is a game changer I have mature skin and the less product under the eyes the better I use eye cream a bit of concealer and a touch of this and im done with my under eyes great product This product is terrific Amazing I have tried sampled and bought probably 30 products to camouflage my dark undereye circles and I almost despaired of finding anything that would work for me Then I saw a review of this on Youtube and decided to try yet another one This one is different The color on my computer is misleading  I got LightMedium and it is a very forgiving formula that has a flesh tone that will likely work with many skin tones Theres also a darker version With this I dont need to apply concealer on top Its just different from any other corrector or concealer If you are frustrated trying to find something that works give this a shot Wonderful Sephora you can return it if it doesnt work for you\\nread more Love thisa little goes a long way Lightweight great for daily use Blends as a primer beautifully with

just disappointed I didnt splurge for it earlier I have had no new starts of pimples so I dont think it will make me break out I know a lot of people are recommending it as a night cream but it also

Adds a beautiful glow with slightly blurring effects and great hydration Amazing whipped mouse like texture Great for brightening sun protection and hydrating In terms of getting rid of dark spots I havent used this long enough to know whether or not it will work but as someone who is obsessed with skincare and effective ingredients I can honestly say this is the best spf I have ever used and the ingredients are great for what it claims to do although works way better if paired with a vitc serum in the morning Truth be told after years of dealing with hyperpigmentation I truly only recommend retinol AHAs and vitc serums Nonetheless everyone and their mother should be using an spf and I find this is the only one that doesnt break me out leave a white cast or gets greasy throughout the day Thus if your skin is dull slightly on the dry side or normal and you wanna kick up your vit c serum a notch I would definitely recommend this If you hate shimmer like effects or radiant finishes this may not be your cup of tea and I would recommend an spf from either Farmacy or Supergoop for those looking for beneficial ingredients\\nread more I have been using this for two weeks and the change in

gotten used to it and have even started to enjoy the deep grassy herbal aroma A little goes a long way and though it feels a little greasy initially I wake up with super soft skin Great first product for that age where youre in between using anti aging products and not if you want to begin a skin regimen that doesnt exactly include specific anti aging ingredients adding this oil prior to your moisturizer will make a difference I dont like the smell per day but the results are lovely and my skin feels glowing and soft Thank you Caudalie This oil is amazing I use it alone at night with eye cream after cleansing my skin  my redness is gone my face looks brighter and I believe that even some of the lines around my mouth have faded Im just about to purchase my second bottle I cannot recommend a better oil for my sensitive skin The scent is woodsy but disappears quickly This product is incredible In two weeks of use the fine lines I was getting around my mouth smile lines really have disappeared I was concerned at first bc my skin looked like it was purging all the living contents out of it the first couple days but glad I stuck with it I have clearer smoother skin and a move

soft and radiant next day It absorbs really fast and it doesnt clog pores The smell is not my favorite but its mild and goes away pretty fast Ive been really loving this When I wake up my skin feels so soft and smooth and I feel like its been helping with some of my scarring as well Like other people have mentioned there is a strong weird smell kind of grassyherbal however the smell doesnt linger  it goes away after a couple minutes My skin has been soaking this up and feeling amazing Im really glad I purchased this  Best oil Ive ever used I tried so many kind of oil from Sephora but nothing helps my skin They either too thick clog pore or doesnt absorb But with this oil omg I love it it helps my skin with acne dark spots and even with red spots Im not sure how other people think about the scent but its pretty relaxing for me Use night time only 67 drops to the palm massage to face Use after toner and serum before night cream or moisturizer A bottle last me about 56 months I already bought 2nd bottle for backup Thanks Caudalie\\nread more Love this Wasnt sure but decided to give it a try My foundation goes on smoothly and since it has SPF 30 I dont have to apply separate sunscreen on most days Feels luxurious but not greasy I love this product It doesnt have that annoying sunscreen smell that other products have A little goes a long way Have used other First Aid products that caused me to break out so I was skeptical of this howeverrr it has quickly turned into one of my must have products It has given my skin that boost of hydration that I didnt know I needed A little bit really does go a long way I found I get oily if I put too much on Ive been using this daily for two months and have surprisingly noticed my pores are less visible and my skin is much more radiant Will definitely keep buying\\nread more Loved this product Just a little goes a long way Just a small size is needed for your entire face It you have excess I put in on my throat or back of my hand It feels greasy when you 1st put it on but it absorbs nicely so when you put on foundation or concealer it goes on well I especially like the pump because you get everything out of the pump till the very last bit of the cream Unlike other products that have a straw to pump the product out leaving so much excess in the bottle this pump pushes out the product entirely\\nread more The best moisturizer EVERRRR  Goes on so smoothly leaving skin with a bright flawless poreless polished finish  minimizing imperfections  works great for me I love this product I use it over vitamin c serum good gene  I really love this stuff pricey but worth it will continue to use this day and night I use this as my daily face cream Love that it has SPF its not greasy at all does not cause breakouts I highly recommend this product especially if you do not have oily skin I has a creamy smooth feel in application This is the best  I have tried to find another brand that is slightly cheaper to use for an every day moisturizer with sunscreen but nothing compares to this one It goes on so light weight and smooth It really does feel like a serum as well as a light moisturizer It is costly but a bottle last me a while and I cannot find anything that comes close to comparing So I am a convert and will stick with this one from now on\\nread more I have used this SPF lotion for a long time like years and I really love it I like the pump packaging which protects the ingredients and I like the texture and how its absorbed It also has SPF which I think all daytime lotions should have I have tried other products and always come back to this one But I will say the age delay and 5 in 1 claims are sort of hooey Other than having SPF this product does nothing to help with aging or wrinkles that Ive seen I have other products to do that\\nread more Moisturizes but also feels light Best moisturizer for my combination skin yet Most moisturizers that contain spf make my face beak out not this one Love this product Lasts a long time too I have been trying to find a sunscreen to use forever At the age of 28 I really wish someone wouldve helped me find a sunscreen earlier  before the ones I tried smelled like sunscreen made me shiny even though I have dry skin and sometimes had an off white shade for my darker skin My biggest concern though was that they always clogged my pores and gave me pimples That same day of the day later after wearing sunscreen I had a pimple This 5 in 1 product did everything I was looking for and more Im obsessed Only been wearing for a week but it moisturizes so well leaving my skin soft It doesnt smell much like anything to me so its fine with me a slight pleasant scent if anything It leaves such a nice glow that doesnt seem to fade with the day unlike the oily look that other sunscreens would leave It gives me a more even tone somehow and makes it look like I have a BB cream on Ive used it around my eyes without any problems and best of all no pimples I think this product will be a favorite of my for decades Very happy with this brand\\nread more So far this product is great It goes on a little oily like sunscreen but absorbs quickly Throughout the day I can feel it if I touch my face but it doesnt look shiny or oily and it doesnt feel heavy I dont wear make up except maybe some powder on my nose and it goes on nice and smooth Ive been using this every day for about two weeks and Ive noticed my tone is slightly brighter and more even I also have sensitive skin and havent had any problems I would buy this again\\nread

especially clams down redness and eczema I got this moisturizer in my FabFitFun box I have combination skin and before using this I had terrible uncontrollable cystic acne around my chin This moisturizer provided enough moisture to keep my skin hydrated during the cold winter months in Canada but it also absorbs SO quickly and is not oilygreasy Since using it my acne is almost nonexistent could be the moisturizer or my hormones finally regulating Im not sure but I finally found a cream that has not broken me out or worsened my acne The price tag is high but I think it is definitely worth the splurge\\nread more I love love this moisturizer I rely on this all winter here in Canada I love how thin and nonsticky this cream feels You do not need a lot of product either I love the pump setting and it keeps the container nice and clean It lasts me for months It is worth the price I believe I highly recommend this moisturizer for the winter time I have dry sensitive skin too and this works perfect for me Received this product in a box  full size I started using it on my leg which was inflamed I am routinely troubled with flared skin similar to eczema issues Over a two week period  my skin calmed down enough that the redness bumps and itchiness were just a memory at my dermatology appointment Of course this is fairly expensive for body issues but it really made a difference for me I feel like my entire adult life has been spent finding a moisturizer that works for my sensitive combination skin Most everything has caused me either to breakout in my oily zones or feel like it did nothing This has become my holy grail My skin feels moisturized but not oily I really do notice a change in the redness I usually have especially during the winter Best of all no zits So impressed with this moisturizer Makes skin so soft and non greasy and balances skin so well This is my new favorite moisturizer I put it on last night and all day my face has felt so soft and moisturized My skin is a little sensitive at times and not prone to acne I have very dry skin in the winter and this moisturizer keeps my skin plump This stuff is amazing I keep mine in the fridge and use it after my cleanser It has actually helped clean my acne Its like the holy grail of moisturizers A sephora employee recommended this to me because she saw the redness on my face I have sensitive skin that gets dry and seriously this stuff stops the red and keeps my skin hydrated Its pricier than other things Ive used but it works and if you have skin redness you might want to give it a shot I will die if they ever remove this product I use it everyday and have been for over 5 years Hands down if I could take one thing to a deserted island it would be this I am oil but also had dry skin in the past due to acne medicine and this product has gotten me through everything and is the only moisturizer I will ever use I would cry if I could have a lifetime supply of this product Its amazing  After using it for a couple weeks my face started to glow and look great Definitely getting the big size I love this product I have combo skin and its perfectly absorbs every time without oily residue

more hydrating Definitely recommend I am 24 and it keeps my skin plump and hydrated I use it nightly even tho it says to use it 2x a week Will rebuy when I run out Is very effective at an amazing price with a lot of product So soothing to put on skin wakes up seriously plump and fresh looking This stuff really works try it  This product feels luxurious without having to high a price tag You get over 2 ounces of product and a little goes a long way I use this at night and let it settle into my skin while reading a book before going to bed It feels lovely on the skin but it does have a

focusing more on skin care rather than makeup lately and this product is definitely making a difference in my skin I am 54 so wrinkles and thinning skin are an issue This product does not take away

Ive been starting to develop have been softening and arent as noticeable as they were before I started using this I actually noticed a difference in them after the first night The instructions suggest using it twice a week but I use it every night and havent had any issues If youre trying to decide between this one and the blue Water Bank sleep mask keep in mind that the instructions on the blue mask ask you to apply a separate moisturizer before using it and this one doesnt That kind of makes up for the 14 price difference in my opinion They are equally as moisturizing but I do feel like this one helps with antiaging better I will be repurchase this\\nread more disclaimer all skin is different im acne prone and this product did not cause a breakout on my face i definitely wake up

way better than the water sleeping mask A little goes a long way So it will last forever I was very shocked how good this lotion is It is very moisturizing and helped with my dry spots It is a bit of a thicker lotion than I am used to but it is great for the price point I use it at night and sometimes during the day before I do my makeup I highly recommend classic product that is amazing great for cystic acne few ingredients makes skin happy and healthy This goes on nicely but I think I prefer the Cream version Nice for the summer hot days I am allergic to almost everything and most everything

I really really do  So I have oily skin well combination oily acne prone skin and I adore this I know some people with acne have said they dont like this but for me this doesnt cause me any acne issues at all and it also doesnt make my skin oily so I think even oily girls can use this Now for why I love this it is SUPER hydrating  Which is actually great for oily skin Oily skin is just a response to skin thats actually dehydrated so the more hydration you add to your skin the less oil it will produce Ive found this to be the case with this lovely moisturizer Another reason I love it is because it gives your skin a bit of a glowdew which I kind of have been more into lately Last thing thats great about this is that it can actually double as a primer idk what it is but its so hydrating I guess that foundation looks great on top of it If I do ever put this on and feel like my skin has a little too much dew before my foundation Ill just blot with a tissue before applying my foundation I adore this Ive been using it for 6 months and have repurchased and will continue too its AMAZING \\nread more I love this as a primer for dry skin this makes your foundation look so

it a try I had been struggling with a few red spots on my cheekbone for the last few months that were raised and itchy I was using all the moisturizers a cleanhealthy skin regiment and was thinking I

other moisturizers  I hope it helps you as it did me \\nread more I use this over mist or not It preps my skin for serums and boosters Have extremely reactive sensitive acne prone skin and I find this

put chemicals and cheap junk into I was surprised by the ingredients list It is all amazing ingredients It contains some that I have never tried before I cleansed my face toned and applied this before my moisturizer It sinks deeply into my pores and does NOT leave any residue behind It also did not break me out AT ALL Its actually feels therapeutic to use in my opinion Now if I dont use it in conjunction with my moisturizer my face feels very tight and a little dry I love this essence and I plan to buy a full size bottle when I run out of this one Definitely recommend because if it works

makeup artist used it on me first and I liked it so much I actually bought the bottle Love this toner Very gentle makes your skin feel great My skin used to be acne prone but after trying the AmorePacific line I can say that I have found the perfect products for my skin This toner the enzyme peel and the vintage extract from this brand have all transformed my skin I love that this toner

when my daughter gave me a kit from GLow Recipe that included this cleanser along with the watermelon glow sleeping mask and the watermelon glow pink juice moisturizer I have dry aging skin but on

but it smells clean  like a typical La Mer product I finally decided to write a review as I sit here with my face burning after trying the SKII cleaning line Im not a hype person I never buy into hype and I always do hours and hours of research and testing before buying something especially when its expensive I used this La Mer Cleaning Foam for one year and absolutely love it Its the best cleanser

find a cheaper alternative after I am almost out of this one so I tested a few cleaners I immediately went back online and bought this again after some disaster situations with other cleaners where I face felt like it was on fire and all red and I realized this is still THE BEST Sticking to this and Ive been using one bottle for close to a year now nuts So in actuality its not that expensive also

smells like cheap soaps A waste of money Love it One of the best cleansers and THE BEST foaming cleanser I have tried In the last few weeks I tried few different brands including La Prairie Lancer Kiehls Origins and few more Some of them were too drying didnt remove the makeup or left my skin too drytight La Mer cleanser gel made my skin very dry and irritated so I tried the foaming cleanser It foams perfectly cleans skin well I also use it with Clarasonic Mia It is expensive but worth it Keeps my skin clear as well\\nread more Love it First time use it drys out my cheek but after several times use I feel clean and comfort Great product but a little pricey This cleanser makes my skin feel more clean than any other cleanser out there A bit comparable to Amore Pacific foam cleanser You literally only use less than a pea size amount And used in combination with the Creme de la Mer the results are truly magical love it it can create nice foam without using foaming net I love all la mer products Only exfoliant Ive found that helps milia An all around wonderful product I have a pretty good complexion and started to break out after trying a new foundation a Sephora employee

it will last a long time Love this product so much It has become a staple in my routine and Ive purchased it multiple times Definitely brings my skin back when it has been through it On my second bottle I hate the pump as it does squirt out beyond your cotton pad However the juicy goodness inside is so magical that I can overlook the packaging flaws This is a staple in my skincare routine because it is a phbalanced formula and gives my thirsty winter combination skin a quenching kickstart to my skincare regime My favorite toner now  No heavy scent and no alcohol The only thing that

skin specialist at Sephora based on my skins needs My favourite toner Super moisturising and lightweight This toner has done wonders to help me stabilize my sensitive breakoutprone skin The

i dont it helps prevent breakouts and for my dry skin its perfect I love this Its not drying and leaves my skin balanced and clean without feeling stripped The very light fragrance is a delightful bonus I try other products but always come back to clinique clarifying lotion 2 It is in expensive and a bottle lasts a long time I prefer to earn points and get freebies from sephora Ive been using this product for years and it is a great exfoliate After I take my makeup off and wash my face I use this and it really does take off the rest of everything you thought you cleaned It makes my face feel extremely fresh and is great to apply before hydrating your body with toner essence serum moisturizer etc However this isnt for all skin types My skin type is normal I have a friend who cant use this because its too harsh on her skin so it isnt for everyone\\nread more LOVE this product Its not that expensive and actually helps remove what you didnt get off after makeup remover AND cleansing I bought this 3 times the third time I bought the large bottle because it was only 10 more But using this every other day even thought it says everyday which you can totally do or just on days you feel extra grimy or was exposed to more gunk is a SKINsaver Ive been using this for a little over a week now and its pretty amazing I saw results from the first application It instantly made my skin smoother softer and it pretty much eliminated all the dry patches and texture Also it helped a lot with acne Thank God I listened to these reviews I recently added this toner to my routine to help clear my acne I have moderate acne mainly located on my cheeks In just a week and a half if has almost cleared it completely I am shocked I have tried almost every clarifying skincare product and this is the only one that has worked I could not recommend this product more it is AMAZING Tried the mini size of this toner from a different set and loved it so I got the big size I had a few tiny pimplesbumps on my face which cleared out after a few uses of this toner and my skin has been clear so far However it does have a fairly strong alcohol scent so you have to be careful not to apply it too close to your eye area A Sephora employee recommended this product to me and Ive been so happy with it it I have used this product for years and havent found anything I like better It has a gentle cool tingling effect when applied that I really enjoy It seems to be effective at exfoliating and helping to remove all makeup I use a Clarisonic and this help gets the little bits of makeup that get left behind on heavy makeup days I have hormonal acne prone combo skin an this seems to help keep the break outs in check\\nread more I have used this product for years and am always happy with the results I stopped using it a few years ago and then started again and I fell back in love with the product I recommend this to anyone with combination skin like myself My husband and I both use this and love it It takes off left over make up that I didnt even know was still there I got this on the black Friday sale for 18 I think Leaves my skin feeling super clean and fresh Has a kind of minty feeling and it doesnt dry out my skin I like this a lot I absolutely LOVE this stuff I have combination skin mostly oily though and occasionally suffer from acne Ive been using this for a little over two years now and man one bottle lasts forever Granted I dont typically use it everyday usually just when I wear a full face of makeup and want to make sure I get it all off And let me just say it does just that and leaves my face feeling fresh afterwards 100010 would recommend\\nread more I bought this on the recommendation of the sales clerk because I have very dry skin and it has honestly been the BEST skincare item I have invested in I have bought much more high end products and drug store but One of them have given me results as noticeable as this My skin no longer has dry flaky patches Will definitely repurchase I have been using this for about a year now and I absolutely love it It makes my skin so soft and smooth This tingles and can sometimes sting my sensitive eczema skin However I find it works wonderfully on my tzone area keeping oil and pimples away I use 1 toner on the rest of my face It may seem like too many steps but for my fussy skin the combo works beautifully Removes my waterproof eyeliner very quickly and easily other makeup removers dont work as well on my MAC liquid last eyeliner and is not harsh on the eyes Definitely recommend A little dab will do ya on a Qtip for use of under eye makeup After washing I sometime dont get all the mascara off so this comes in perfectly its not oily or sting my eyes even if i use it on a cotton ball Very gentle quick and easy to use without making a mess I use this to remove my makeup every night Highly recommend it for sensitive eyes Im in live with this stuff I dont use a cotton sheet to apply the remover For me it works best with just fingers To wipe off  I then use the cotton sheets This stuff is a holy grail product to me My eyes are so sensitive and the area under my eyes is very dry and burns if I try to use any other remover This stuff is so gentle but it breaks down makeup more than any remover Ive tried before I love this eye makeup remover Its very gentle and leaves my eye area feeling moisturized You dont need much either Its also the best Ive used to completely remove makeup with other brands Ive used I have to scrub hard to get makeup off LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff I found this holy grail of a makeup remover It takes waterproof mascara right off without leaving a greasy residue Yes this will burn your eyes So keep your eyes closed when applying Next you dont need a cotton pad to use this All you need is 1 pump onto your palm or fingers Apply on lids full of makeup with eyes closed and rub gently You may use a cotton pad to wipe away the removed makeup or wash your face thoroughly So easy I hope they dont change the formula or discontinue this I use an incredibly waterproof japanese brand mascara that needs its own remover but this is a wonderful alternative\\nread more Im on my third bottle I love this product The obvious burn IF you get it into your eyes but Ive never experienced any problems just an easy apply and removal of my make up I simply rinse it off Also I use this mainly because its so gentle at removing my mascara that i dont have to worry about constantly losing my eyelashes from wipes Works really well to remove my stubborn mascara and doesnt irritate my eyes like other makeup removers Ive tried every eye makeup remover that claims to be for sensitive eyes This is the only one that actually removes my mascara AND doesnt irritate the delicate skin around my eyes A Sephora employee used this on me to remove a bunch of liquid lipstick swatches from my hand and I was shocked at how quickly and easily it took it all off no scrubbing whatsoever I bought it during the next sale and have been using it ever since If you think its not working then Id suggest using a little more and letting is soak on a cotton pad first and holding in on your eyes for a few seconds so that the cleanser can penetrate through all the layers of makeup and do not rub or tug at the eye area We dont want wrinkles so be gentle and just let it sit and do the work for you so that you dont have to go over the same area a bunch of times Would not suggest going straight in on your eyes without a cotton pad also works really really well on a makeup eraser Would suggest shaking it before each use as Ive found it does settle a little bit if it hasnt been used in a while Would definitely recommend if you wear a lot of heavy andor waterproof eye makeup I wouldnt call it a sensitive eye cleanser I have sensitive eyes and sometimes it does sting but it works so Ill deal with it as its nothing unbearable and the sting goes away quickly\\nread more I was sceptical of this cleanser because I tried other KS products in the past and I didnt like them However now I regret I didnt try this cleanser earlier Yes it can be drying and it does smell pretty strong sulphur even after rinsing my face but it works I do not remove make up with it but I use it in the mornings with my Foreo brush Love it This cleanser is absolutely amazing Give this cleanser a shot at least a week You will see a significant reduction in the number of breakouts you have less redness and a smoother texture to tie skinI have tried SOO many things to help my acne This is the best cleanser and the results are fast This product singlehandedly got my acne under control I tried everything from prescriptions to facials to using the most dull products Cerave Cetaphil Nothing helped me like EradiKate did A little goes a long way I love how clean it smells and I cant imagine my life without it If you have cystic acne this product will definitely help you I love this cleanser I use it twice a day and it keeps annoying blemishes at bay and fights hormonal acne I have clear skin with the exception of random zits here and there but have always struggled with break outs when monther nature comes to town This cleanser has completely changed the game If youre thinking of buying this cleanser DO IT I first tried this product back in July when I found out I was pregnant with my first child I have always liked using an acne oil control face wash in the AM but my current one contained salicylic acid which is not safe to use during pregnancy I talked to my doctor about pregnancy safe alternatives and did lots of online research which led me to this product Not only is it pregnancy safe but it is probably the most effective acne cleanser I have ever used I have far fewer breakouts even with my hormones going crazy from pregnancy and it does wonders for keeping shine at bay in my tzone while not over drying the rest of my face I should mentioned I have combo skin and tend to have a very oily tzone but normaldry cheeks I only use this is the AM followed by a vitamin c serum and moisturizer It has a bit of a sulfur smell but hey what do you expect from a cleanser that has sulfur as an active ingredient The smell doesnt linger on your face but can linger on your device if you use one to wash your face I use the FOREO Luna 3 and have to make sure I rinse all the cleanser out after each wash to keep the smell away This is definitely a product I will continue to buy even after I can use salicylic acid again it is just so good\\nread more I noticed a difference in my skin the very first time I used it For years Ive been using an acne face wash and I would see products with cleanser on it and I decided to do some research on the difference between fash wash and face cleanser A cleanser gets beneath the skin whereas a fash wash just gets the surface After doing some research on a ance cleanser thats good for sensitive skin I came across this product The very first time I washed my face with this product my skin looked brighter and I have little to know acne I didnt even get my normal PD acne like I usually would Definitely will be purchasing again\\nread more After one use my skin was less red and looked so much better the morning after I have oilycombo somewhat sensitive skin and my skin has responded so well to this Ive been using it for about a year now and this was my first time using something that included sulfur as an ingredient I use this once a day in the morning and thats been enough to

in the mornings with my Foreo brush Love it This cleanser is absolutely amazing Give this cleanser a shot at least a week You will see a significant reduction in the number of breakouts you have less redness and a smoother texture to tie skinI have tried SOO many things to help my acne This is the best cleanser and the results are fast This product singlehandedly got my acne under control I tried

life without it If you have cystic acne this product will definitely help you I love this cleanser I use it twice a day and it keeps annoying blemishes at bay and fights hormonal acne I have clear skin with the exception of random zits here and there but have always struggled with break outs when monther nature comes to town This cleanser has completely changed the game If youre thinking of buying this cleanser DO IT I first tried this product back in July when I found out I was pregnant with my first child I have always liked using an acne oil control face wash in the AM but my current one contained salicylic acid which is not safe to use during pregnancy I talked to my doctor about pregnancy safe alternatives and did lots of online research which led me to this product Not only is it pregnancy safe but it is probably the most effective acne cleanser I have ever used I have far fewer breakouts even with my hormones going crazy from pregnancy and it does wonders for keeping shine at bay in my tzone while not over drying the rest of my face I should mentioned I have combo skin and tend to have a very oily tzone but normaldry cheeks I only use this is the AM followed by a vitamin c serum and moisturizer It has a bit of a sulfur smell but hey what do you expect from a cleanser that has sulfur as an active ingredient The smell doesnt linger on your face but can linger on your device if you use one to wash your face I use the FOREO Luna 3 and have to make sure I rinse all the cleanser out after each wash to keep the smell away This is definitely a product I will continue to buy even after I can use salicylic acid again it is just so good\\nread more I noticed a difference in my skin the very first time I used it For years Ive been using an acne face wash and I would see products with cleanser on it and I decided to do some research on the difference between fash wash and face cleanser A cleanser gets beneath the skin whereas a fash wash just gets the surface After doing some research on a ance cleanser thats good for sensitive skin I came across this product The very first time I washed my face with this product my skin looked brighter and I have little to know acne I didnt even get my normal PD acne like I usually would Definitely will be purchasing again\\nread more After one use my skin was less red and looked so much better the morning

dont need another cleanser I can use this and it will last me for months I just received the product yesterday morning I love it so far It smells good and makes my skin feel so fresh and clear Im only on day 2 of it Love this cleanser Started with a mini size and bought the full size afterRemoves makeup well and skin doesnt feel dry afterwards The smell is divine and after using it my skin is soft and clear You dont need to wash your face again with another cleanser afterwards This is the only cleansing balm that I have found that does not burn my sensitive eyes This is very gentle a nice thick balm that almost liquefies on contact with the skin It does emulsify but I use it as recommended with the muslin cloth to wipe it off If I use just the cleansing balm by itself my skin feels a bit dry afterwards I always follow up with my Clarisonic and a waterbased cleanser afterwards anyways so for me its not a problem I enjoy the smell very much it smells very natural herbal and spa like to me This does a good job removing my long lasting sunblock I would recommend this for people who do wear a lot of make up and are looking for a gentle balm cleanser following up with a waterbased cleanser afterwards I would also recommend this to people who dont wear make up to be used alone as a nourishing facial cleanser I am extremely acne prone and this has not broken me out or clogged my pores The most important thing to me about this is that it doesnt bother my sensitive eyes\\nread more Worth the hype and the cost I have sensitive sometimes oilysometimes acne prone always battling rosacea skin and this stuff is amazing I pair it with the SKII lotion or essence and then the Tatcha water cream and my skin is kept at bay from flare ups and angry redness and breakouts for the most part The muslin is really key too as I was attempting to create a shortcut by skipping that step but honestly it was a waste of my time The muslin makes this both a regular cleanser and a light exfoliant but not irritating to anyone with sensitive concerns I find I like the kind of herbygrassy smell it works when you follow the instructions and create a little mini facial thing there with the pressure points and whatever Anyway it works and I stock up during the big sales so I am never without it The small containers are great for travel as they done leak or anything\\nread more Best makeup removing balm I ever had It is a perfect combination of makeup removing cleansing moisturizer toner and it could be used with good massage for lifting The steps are a little bit complicated but once you learn the steps and get used to itjust baby steps not hard to learn if you try to remember you will feel lost if you dont use it daily It has a divine and natural smell The hotwater and coldwater attaining is just so relaxing I had less acne and smoother skin after using this and I feel really happy after every mornings routine including it It is expensive it should be\\nread more I have been using this product for several months and I love it I have oily skin and I havent had a major outbreak since I started using it exclusively This is the clearest my skin has been in my adult life and Im in my 40s Would recommend starting with the mini size to see if it works for you but the money spent has been worth it for me Obsessed with this cleanser It melts into your skin and dissolves makeup and lightly exfoliates with the included muslin cloth Also smells divine 1010 recommend This Eve Lom Cleanser takes all the makeup and dirt off my effectively Its easy to use and gentle on my skin I love how this products works in taking my makeup off and leaving my skin feel soft Its very gentle and i highly recommend you guys to try it Holy grail cleanser This product is awesome Removes makeup perfectly and leaves the skin feeling super clean and moisturized Love the herbal smell and it even comes with a cleansing cloth Highly recommended Ive converted to using exclusively balm cleansers to remove my makeup and this is just about the only thing that plows through my face makeup and mascara eyeliner The smell doesnt bother me too much and the texture is the perfect blend of solid and creamy and easily melts into my skin when I rub it in with gentle circles Not sure if I can go back to liquid makeup removers after this One of the best cleansers I have ever tried granted this is the only balm cleanser Ive tried Ive tried gel oil cream cleansers Oil cleansers are great but theres something really satisfying about being able use this cleanser as a gel and then also a milk cleanser after wetting it with water It gets off my waterproof mascara and my face feels super clean but not tight or dry after rinsing off I have oily sensitive skin but it hasnt exacerbated either of these conditions Really really impressed with this Also the muslin cloth that it comes with is a great bonus I was able to receive this product for free through Octoly\\nread more For a mineral oil cleanser this is amazing Feels amazing on the skin and I absolutely love the cloth that comes with it too Incrediable formula  Lightweight a little goes a long way Doesnt clog pores Cleans deep and takes off hard mascara Doesnt burn eyes Very gentle formula Love this and the results are amazing it smells great and the sugar dissolves after a few seconds A worker at sephora recommended this and I was hesitant so I bought the small size Im so glad I got it i will be purchasing again I love it and i love the results Im on week 2 My skin after using is almost like a velvet finish super soft Love this so much Who knew exfoliating and moisturizing could be combined This is another splurge item for me When I buy and use it it feels like pure luxury though The exfoliation isnt harsh and the fragrance is so good you will want to eat it Highly recommend for gentle exfoliating especially if you have sensitive andor dry skin Instant gratification If you want something more long lasting and heavy duty this probably isnt what youre looking for though\\nread more This product works wonders for freshening up my face Even just a few mins smooths out my skin and brightens my face I use more frequently in a couple of situations first in the winter as I live in a cold climate and my skin can get a bit dry and second if Im spending lots of time in the sun with a stronger sunscreen as it helps to deep clean the sunscreen off If I could give this 10 stars I would I have extremely dry flaky skin and this made my skin softer than butter The granules are not too abrasive and the smell is divine I will repurchase again and again Fresh promise me youll never change the formula Love love this product It exfoliates extremely well and leaves my face baby soft and glowing I have sensitive skin and I will say that it is a tad harsh and leaves my face red after but I use it before bed so its not a big deal Also the smell is sugary lemon which I adore I recommend for sure I feel like I dont need to leave a review youve said it all Best exfoliator on the market Hands down best exfoliator Ive ever used Wish it came in a huge jar Smells amazing and god does it leave your skin soft and moisturized If you wanted to skip your skin care routine after using this you can feel confident that your face is moisturized Really like the feel and texture of the product Leaves the skin soft and dewy I can use it a couple times a week without any issues even tho I have sensitive skin Looooove this Smells so good and leaves your skin really soft  This product is gentle enough that I use it at least 5x per week I use the Fresh Soy Face Cleanser first and then I apply this right after and leave for 1015 minutes I love how it makes my face feel so soft and clean afterwards I sometimes will use this in the morning to exfoliate my face before I put on my foundation because it helps my foundation to be applied smoother Okay so Ive seen some bad reviews on this thing so I got the mini to try it out since I never exfoliate and realized I needed to start doing it and I didnt have high expectations but oh my god it works so much better than I thought it wouldve First of all it seems so freaking good and you dont even need to use a lot of it so the mini is lasting me a long time And maybe this is because the only other exfoliator I have ever used is that Kate Somerville one but years ago so I dont know that much about them but I saw the difference right away like no kidding Before I even washed it off my face looked so much brighter and glowy its crazy And afterward my entire face was so incredibly smooth that I couldnt stop feeling my face And I dont know but my face just looks so much better and like new and fresh So you definitely definitelyyyy need to try this one out especially if youre new to exfoliators\\nread more All i have to say is I cant believe how my skin feels after using this product LIKE A BABY would be my closest guess I waited to write this review after I saw how it did overnight I have super dry skin so even putting 3 moisturizers on at night I still usually wake up dry Not today My skin is still amazingly smooth and hydrated 1010 recommend Ps I was a rebel and decided to try and use it as a makeup remover too It got ALL my foundation off Just dont rub too hard on your face \\nread more Honestly the BEST natural exfoliant I have tried The texture is sugary and you know that its made with natural ingredients Its super easy to apply and my favorite part is when you wash it off The sugary texture exfoliates your skin just enough as you wash it off and completely melts away Your skin is super soft afterwards proving how efficient the exfoliation works I love this product for weekly exfoliation My skin feels so soft after This is a gentle exfolitor and it is not too grainy and rough on my sensitive skin This makes your face so smooth and soft I used this years ago and since have been kind of lax on skincare I noticed my face dull not smooth and in need of repair I fell back on what I knew and with no regret In just a weeks time using every other morning my face feels smoother and looks brighter Will continue to use this in my new cleansing routine This is the best face wash Ive ever used It even removed my eye makeup so no need for an extra step Be sure to follow up with a good serum and moisturizer I have sensitive skin and this does not bother me at all I also love the smell So glad I tried the sample Ive been using this cleanser for over 10 years now I love the all PTR skin cleansers and exfoliating face and body washes Ive tried others for over the years used them intermittently but none of the other cleaners come close to the PTR cleansing products The results are outstanding with or without the use of manual exfoliating tools washcloths Clarisonic etc which is impressive I would have thought by now my skin would have adapted to the products and thered be a plateau of some sort but that hasnt happened Its a miracle in a bottle clears the blemishesacne unevenness in tone even helps with elasticity WORTH IT\\nread more Absolutely love this line by PTR  This Cleansing Wash is great for all over your body  It lathers very well  Forever my favorite cleanser Ive been using this cleanser for 12 years now As Ive gotten older my skin has become more sensitive so I cant use it every day like before when it was more oilyacne prone I use it 2 times a week now I love the smell and love that a drop goes a long way Love how it brightens and tightens my skin every time Thus cleansing gel is phenomenal Ive used so many different cleaners and every time there was something lacking in one aspect or the other I received a sample size of thus and proceeded to buy the full size after one week My skin has been clearer more vibrant refined and overall balanced I have combinationoily skin  some dry patches and others are normal This is the first facial cleanser that has checked off all my requirements The smell is light and feminine and this is my favorite part of my skincare routine\\nread more Refreshing way to cleanse your skin I use it daily and love the way it brightens my skin I have tried multiple face washes over the years and I keep coming back to this one My husband actually uses every day now too We keep 1 in the shower and 1 by our sink so we both use this 2x a day I do notice a difference when I try something else for a month or so Buy this product you wont regret it The bottle lasts a very long time While not too terribly expensive this is the best face wash I have found to date A little can go a long way and I dont usually use this every day as it can make me red if used too frequently After Sephora stopped carrying my previous wash a clerk sheepishly suggested this and I was so embarrassedangryinahurry that I overspent on this or so I thought I have now tried several other face washes a couple that are even more expensive but I have found the best results for me with some gentle exfoliation combined with the PTR cleanser I am less oily for longer I break out usually after skipping this for too long I can feel tight with this but if used in rotation I find it to be pleasant and youthful rather than drying\\nread more Loving this cleanser Its a little bit drying so you have to be careful how often you use it But my skin looks even and fresh for the past month Ive been using This is my goto morning cleanser and is the only thing that keeps my little hair line bumps away I use the PTR water drench cleanser at night but this one is my jammmmm My most favorite cleanser Takes off all makeup and mascara Very gentle Use this with Clarisonic or wash cloth and it leaves my skin clean without overly dried out So worth the money The only cleansing gel I would use Amazing cleansing gel this product clean really well and make my skin glow and soft I also use this cleanser as a body wash Loves it This was given to me as a gift so I decided to try it I have rosacea and sensitive skin so I thought this might be too harsh It was in the shower for me to use once a week as an exfoliator until I switched it to my everyday cleanser Thats when I noticed how nice my skin started to look It doesnt strip my face or leave it tight feeling but I do have to moisturize afterwards But my skin has become poreless I even am seeing my fine lines less This product works for me Be careful because it does have acids that will strip your face and one could end up over exfoliating I dont use any other exfoliating product because its too harsh for my skin So this cleanser the PTR rentinol And a thick moisturizer twice a day and I have Sansa Stark skin Ill be buying this for myself once Im done with what I have\\nread more Nothing gets my face as clean and healthy feeling as this cleansing Gel  been using it for years cant be without it Ive been using and repurchasing this face cleanser for the past 10 years or so It works so well for me in that it cleanses without making my skin feel tight or irritated and works very well at removing any residual makeup that my cleansing oilsbalms doesnt take off This is definitely a gentle yet effective cleanser and I always recommend it to my friends I typically use about a nickel size on my silicone scrubby pad at night and in the morning i use about half the amount It lasts me about 34 months with daily use\\nread more I havent been too fussy about my skincare routine until recently when I figured Im getting older over 40 so I had better start caring I bought this hoping for a gentle but effective cleanser My skin has literally never been so soft A little goes a long way and my skin feels clean definitely not dry and lovely afterwards Im sticking with it I bought this facewash because of the review that says she wanted to date it I was not disappointed No breakouts and gentle Make sure the cap is tight or it will spill everywhere My skin is so clear since using this face wash Havent broken out or any irritations I love Kiehls products and needs a new face wash This does the job nice foaming action light scent and a little goes a long way Good size for the price too Highly recommend I love this line of products at kiehls The cleanser toner and moisturizer work perfectly for my skin I have oily skin and the gelcream like texture of the cleanser washes away everything even most makeup Usually not intense waterproof makeup but it will wash away foundation and powders My ALLTIME favorite face wash Its so gentle great for sensitive skin and ALWAYS gets my makeup off It is my goto skincare item I have combination skin and Ive had pesky bumps on my forehead forehead for YEARS Ive tried lines for all kinds of skin but surprisingly this worked the best for me Within 24 hours my forehead is about 50 clearer I used it in conjunction with the toner and the face cream and Im thrilled with my results I have combination skin and this cleanser has been amazing Ive been using it for a few weeks It doesnt dry out my skin and makes it feel so clean I love this Will definitely buy another once this one runs out Very simple cleanser but does the job and did a great job of not making my skin dry Ive been trying to find a cleanser that really worked for me and this is it Super gentle and gets a lot of my dirt from my pores out Also good for removing makeup Great cleanser I use this with the rest of the line  toner moisturizer and creamy eye treatment All of it works wonders together The cleanser is perfect because it doesnt over dry I feel like the headline Ive left for all these products is  a little goes a long way and its so true I literally use a drop of this on my vanity facial brush I love it because I use very little of all of these products which means Ill have them for awhile \\nread more Ive been using this cleanser in conjunction with the ultra facial moisturizer since I was about 13 Im now 21 and these two products have kept my skin feeling great They work together to hydrate and leave your face feeling so nice and clean that I genuinely look forward to using this every morning and night I have dry skin and this feels amazing and never dries out my face I highly recommended and plan on using this as a daily cleanser\\nread more This is amazing A small amount gently takes all of my eye makeup off and makes my skin feel as soft as a babys Better than my holy grail Estée Lauder cleanser And you get a lot for your money Best cotton rounds Ive ever tried They dont fall apart or leave bits of cotton behind and also dont soak up too much product Very well made Always out of stock though snag them now before theyre gone again I waited around 6 months for them to be restocked I really hate wasting expensive product and for that reason I love these pads It absorbs my expensive products well so that I can apply them to my face but it doesnt absorb like a cotton ball might so I end up using less product So that makes the cost of having yet another beauty product lying around worth it for me Sephora brand is cheaper than some other similar options but they work just as well as others Ive tried This is a staple product in my beauty arsenal\\nread more I purchased this multiple times already and stocked up during the sale These are very soft and great quality I often prefer these over my shiseido cotton Have never found better cotton pads to remove makeup than these ones I am very impressed with this quality in comparison to others Allows me to do my whole face with one pad Does not fall apart or sheds like others My new favorite cotton pads These leave no cotton fibers on skin great for toner love that they dont fall apart like most when using them Soft and great price Love these to apply my toner I have been using ONLY these for like a year now They dont fall apart and get all fibery  I can remove my eye makeup with them and it doesnt feel scratchy They are definitely worth the few cents more than drugstore pads Very impressed with my Sephora Soft Touch pads These are really nice and soft but very strong I can remove an entire face of makeup with one pad and my favorite micellar water I got these with my order initially because I was a bit lazy and didnt want to go to the drugstore to pick some up but Honestly I love them so much that Ill be returning for more These are amazing Definitely soft to the touch and way more durable then the drugstore alternative I always buy these if they are in stock I love that these pads are smooth and great for applying toner or taking makeup off I also love that they dont shed These are my favorite inexpensive cotton rounds Soft enough to remove my eye makeup with no discomfort  My favorite cotton pads The edges stay together vs separating like other brands Ive tried Good quality for the price does their job People only say Oh it cleans so well but my skin does not feel tight after using and I never understood what it means until I have this Highly underrated product Im so surprised more people arent talking about this The price is a bit steep but it lasts a really long time Ive had it for

care and wish Id found it years ago I love this cleanser I use it mostly in the mornings as its rather expensive It leavs the skin feeling clean yet hydrated I use it morning and night when traveling as its also great at removing make up Its a very gentle but effective cleanser The ingredients are very simple with amino acids base and willow bark natural BHA to purify pores A great daily cleanser for normal dry skin types I personally think it works best with the Foreo tool I fell in love with this face wash after the first week of using it I have textured adult acne prone skin and this face wash has helped not only with the texture of my skin but with my acne too Its definitely pricey but I use less than a dime sized amount and it does the job I also bought the SK II welcome kit which I use in conjunction with this product This is an amazing cleanser that leaves your skin soft clean and hydrated I use it with my foreo it took a few tries to figure out the right amount to use but a small amount goes a long way Leaves your skin feeling clean but moisturized I break out often and this face wash manages to keep my face in check I see a notable difference in my skin its brighter and my acne scares are fast fading This face wash is expensive but really worth it Itll last you a long time This scrub has changed my skincare game completely I use it about 3xs a week and my skin has never looked better My fine lines are drastically softer dark spots are so subtle I can hardly see them Finally an exfoliating product that isnt too harsh This stuff works incredibly well and leaves my face feeling soft and even I use it about 2x a week Makes all of my other products go on much smoother Guys you do not literally see your dead skin peeling off That is the product balling up It would be insane for that much skin to come off your face with any product That said this does work well at sloughing the skin and leaving your skin smooth and refreshed Smell is fine and doesnt feel

Brants scrub and was looking for something to alternate with Since I use many Clinique products this was a natural choice I dont regret it at all it works like a dream and my skin feels great I have sensitive skin and cant use a lot of products with out it stripping layers around my nose of skin off and this product does no such thing I can enjoy exfoliating my skin again AMAZING product I have tried so many exfoliating face cleansers but this one is by far the best Right after the first wash I saw a huge difference in the look and feel of my face As mentioned in previous reviews the scrub has that mintycool feel while washing and I LOVE THAT 100 would recommend Definitely give it a try you wont regret it This product has lasted me about 4 month with very frequent use about 3 times weekly Not only does it have a wonderful cooling affect which is nice to wake you up in the morning but it also does the best job ever at clearing out pores This product is rough without being too rough for frequent use and you really cant beat the price for what you get Have been using this product for many years skin feels super clean I use it every day in the shower I have used countless scrubs COUNTLESS Alas I have found The One It doesnt make my finicky skin breakout or dry out I got a little oily the first couple times after using it but after incorporating a moisturizer it was smoooooth sailing Bonus my makeup looks so much better after a good sluffing with this exfoliating scrub my forever favourite scrub it is super grainy and my face feels like a babys butt afterwards products go on so much better and my skin always feels so much better after i use it have tried other scrubs but none of them work as well as this one  i always come back the best Love this product works amazing on my skin and I feel so refreshed after using it Definitely needs to be followed with a moisturizer though cause it will dry out your skin Im lucky in that I dont have a lot of breakouts just occasional blemishes My blackheads however are an entirely different story and my pores are shall we say noticeable In less than a week of using every other day to let my skin adjust Ive noticed that it feels much smoother including one of my trouble spots the pores on my chin I used to be able to feel teeny bumps there that are gone now Im assuming those were my pores saying help Im drowning in sebum Ive also noticed a dramatic improvement on my nose the blackheads are either gone or significantly reduced leaving just my pores Im really impressed with this scrub and will probably continue to use it unless and until I find something more effective\\nread more I have sensitive allergyprone skin Before I found Clinique I would often react to skincare products particularly mascara lip products facial cleansers and makeup remover So if you have similar issues I would highly recommend Clinique products Regarding this exfoliating scrub the biggest thing I noticed was it felt good to use this product as it didnt feel like it took my skin away but instead cleared things from my skin such as my blackheads It works very well and my skin loves it too\\nread more I live in Hawaii and cant use chemicals in my skincare because it makes me too sensitive I need to have a natural buff after my clarisonic to exofoliate and make my skin glow This is basic and does the trick Best cleanser on the market I use it every night This is the one item I always have But fyi I use full coverage makeup that needs a strong cleanser Absolutely LOVE this product I have combination skin And this year I started having melasma issues I came back to my holy grail that has helped with my dry patches in the past and after 2 weeks of use my pigmentation has lightened It cleans very well my face feels minty fresh I use only at night and it helps to stimulate collagen production to repair my dark sports and acne scars I follow this product with the Clinique Dark Spot corrector\\nread more left my skin refreshed has a pepperminty fragrance Felt nice and minty Was afraid the cool tingly feeling it gave would burn my sensitive skin but it did a good job of exfoliating without overdrying At first I didnt know whether to apply on dry skin but I still did it Then added a tiny bit of water then worked the product in It felt good during and felt good after I had an aunt whos a dermatologist that recommended me this brand Ive tried this scrub and is FANTASTIC I use it at night before going to sleep because my face gets very oily I work in a kitchen and it feels so refreshing after I use it it feels very different and very nice on the skin it does have a cooling sensation which feels really good on the skin its tooo goood Love this I like gritty scrubs like this usually use every other day or so Daily I use the Clinique 3 step skin care I have sensitive skin and I get occasional breakouts on my chin this has helped with that as well For the longest time I just used drug store face scrubs because of the lower price but feel this had better results over all These wipes are so refreshing and they felt so nice on my skin I love this product Ive never used cleansing wipes before actually and I didnt expect too much I thought Id need more product to clean my makeup But even my eye makeup was very easily cleaned and I feel my face completely hydrated Also the smell is not too heavy Lastly one of my favorite things about this wipes it left a natural glow on my face I always keep these around I dont use them to remove makeup I use them on some morning to remove any night creams or serums I had applied I also dont use wipes on my eyes at all So for my purposes these are refreshing and handy to have around Have bought several times I dont care if they are a little smaller TBH Takes my makeup off without irritation or a werid oily feel afterwards Im quite pleased with them Most makeup wipes burn my face but these did not One of my absolute favorite makeup remover wipes They smell so good  leave my skin feeling so hydrated Most makeup remover wipes irritate my face but these dont They feel so refreshing love them for the summer Great price point A must have These wipes are awesome They smell great theyre a good size theyre thick and they remove makeup well I also like that they have a good amount of wetness to them because I HATE wipes that are barely saturated so you have to scrub your face with them I would definitely repurchase I love almost all the different Sephora Collection cleansing wipes and have repurchased them dozens of times So I was very happy when new types were introduced last year including these hydrating watermelon wipes They smell great remove my makeup efficiently and dont irritate my sensitive skin as long as I wipe and pat gently Like all the Sephora Collection cleansing wipes these wipes are very sturdy and do not fall apart if you want to rinse them with warm water for extra cleansing duty or to remove a mud mask I buy the fullsize packages for home and the car but I also keep the minisize in my purse because theyre perfectly compact and can double as a refreshing hand wipe A summer tip I keep a package of these watermelon wipes in the fridge for hot days when I want to cool off while removing my makeup\\nread more These are fantastic wipes I bought them on a whim and I was so surprised at the quality I have extremely sensitive skin and this does not break me out The light scent is pleasant and does not irritate me These wipes feel soothing on the skin while taking off most of my makeup I really enjoy them and keep rebuying them They work great also to take off liquid lipstick without leaving a bad taste on the lips\\nread more These wipes are perfect for my gym bag It is so refreshing after a workout and leaves your skin feeling so clean Best wipes I ever used These wipes work very well Very Hydrating with a pleasant watermelon smell and removes every last bit of makeup this product really good sense it is easy to bring in its purse Not the best for removing makeup I prefer to use these after I cleanse my face or as a pick me up in the morning These are a second time purchase and are my favorite cleansing cloths Unlike a lot of cleansing cloths which merely removes the make up and dirt these I believe are an actual treatment to my face Besides they smell fabulous which almost makes them worth it just for that Really nice for what they do The top clicks easily shut The clothes definitely hold a lot of moisture until the end They work well and smell on the sweeter side which I like but I can see how theyd be too sweet for some Makes for an easy face wipe when I want to freshen up after the gym My husband and I love these for nights when youre tired or feeling lazy He has oily skin that has balanced with Ole for oily skin and I have dry skin I love these wipes They work great the seal is better than 99 out there and Ive had no negative reactions to them OLEHENRIKSEN has become one of my favorite brands I love the products they make Great product Leaves my skin clean and refreshed and smells amazeballs I got a pack of these in an Ole Henriksen value kit around Christmas 2018 the box had a minitrial size of almost every one of their products It took me forever to finally give the wipes a try I was amazed when I did and mad for not trying them earlier Im the pickiest person about makeup wipes I used these and they worked so well at taking off the makeup Getting the grease and sweat off my face Leaving your face glowy but still clean It basically is a built in toner So that is a huge plus Didnt break out my acne prone skin They left my face smelling so amazing like some sort of citrus and my husband was so into it so thats a plus for sure They are obviously a little more pricey than say Sephora Collection makeup wipes which is what I always used before these ones but Its so worth it to get these If you struggle with dark spots discoloration dry skin This is a fix all in my opinion You cant go wrong with these And they are nice and big so you can chop them up and get more uses if you want I usually cut mine in halfs and use a half in the morning when I wake up to freshen up since I rarely actually wash my face and another at night as the first step in my prebed skin routine So anyway 1010 do recommend Im in love with these wipes and I think theyre going to be my faves for the rest of forever\\nread more Smells amazing Makeup remover face cleanser and face serum all in one Great for on the go or for

cleanser around but it took me a while to try it and honestly I wish I would have tried this one sooner It is extremely gentle and Id say soothing and refreshing Its naturally fragranced and it has a beautiful non overpowering scent I absolutely love the texture its creamy and soft thats one of my favorite things about it I like facial cleansers that do not leave you feeling tight and this one has

cleanser I couldnt believe how much make up was still on my face This cleansing water takes it all off I first got a trial size of this in a Caudalie product set I used it for about a week and really loved that it was a gentle cleanser that also brightened my skin I bought the full size and used it every night when winter started because my skin was too dry for a face wash It did make my eyes feel weird in the morning so I started splashing my closed eyes with water after cleansing with this I only wear very light makeup and just on my eyes so I cant review how well it removes makeup but I do

31 now and have searched for years for my personal holy Grail products quite a few I switch seasonally but this is great year round I was honestly taken aback my the negative reviews but them realized most of them were sensitive or dry skin types which is why I included all the background plus you always want to know if a product is going to help with what your looking for in it\\nread more My skin feels incredibly cleansed after this I sometimes dont even use it after taking off make up just use it to refresh my face and give it a good wipe down I find myself using it more and more frequently

wipes Its perfect for my sensitive acne prone skin I like using this cleanser once a week I noticed a difference in how smooth my skin feels I dont use it daily because my skin develops dry patches because its too strong for me I did like how much better my skin looks just using it minimally and it does make my face feel really clean afterwards I also like that its a nice consistency not watery or goooy and there is no strong smell this smells so fresh i really like it simple and clean makes my skin feel pretty good definitely recommend  I have struggled with drysensitive skin that is prone to redness my whole life I have mild eczema and I have struggled for years to find an exfoliating wash that doesnt leave me extra dry or red This is the only one I have consistently repurchased The exfoliating beads are small and delicate but there are tons of them You cant directly see them in the product because they are so fine but you really feel them working The base of the product is also great it is similar to Cetaphil or CeraVe gentle face washes so the product exfoliates but does not over dry or strip the skin It is very light with minimal scent I can even use this product in the fall and winter when my skin is at its most dry and red Ive recommended this product to tons of friends and they all thank me for it\\nread more Love Doesnt burn your eyes or face Gentle yet effective If youve never used this your life is about to be changed To me this is the be all end all exfoliating cleanser My skin never feels as smooth as it does after I use this cleanser It also has a nice citrus smell Have never found a better exfoliator I decided to splurge on this cleanser because I liked Philosophys Microdelivery Peel This facial wash is like the lighter version of the peel I love the microbeads and how smooth it makes my skin feel I have oily skin thats not very sensitive so it works well for me It beats all the drugstore brands Ive used If you have sensitive skin this might not be for you as the microbeads are a little rough on the skin\\nread more This is my favorite skin care product It makes my face so smooth and a bottle lasts forever I had a sample of this that I put off using and Im so sorry I waited My face has never felt so soft yet clean facial wash smells wonderful and works great to get rid of dead skin this was a sample that I will be purchasing when I run out This face wash is very effective at sloughing off all the nasties yet leaves your skin incredibly soft and smooth The fragrance is uplifting and I find it very soothing to my soul I always come back to this face wash Such a good little scrub whenever you need a little extra exfoliation Very effective physical exfoliator  I keep it in my travel cosmetics bag and its lasted for ages Will definitely buy again Because I have sensitive reactive skin I steered clear of exfoliation But I also have dry skin which NEEDS exfoliation Its been a dilemma That is until I tried Philosophys Microdelivery Exfoliating Face Wash I love this product It exfoliates brilliantly without drying or irritating my skin And it has a charming citrus smell I dont recommend using this product more than once or twice a week I started out using this one everyday and I broke out really bad Overall its a great product and has a nice scent great product packaging needs improvement the bottle it comes in makes it difficult to squeeze the product out if you have arthritis in your fingers you might want to transfer the product in a softer bottle thats easier to squeeze great scrub for exfoliation leaves my skin super soft and smooth felt extra clean after very good price I started getting hormonaldietrelated breakouts along my chin and this fully cleared it up in a week I only use it at night because its too drying to use twice a day I just use a gentle cleanser in the morning Couldnt recommend it enough I used to have mild acne The problem that I have generally with other products is they dry my skin significantly From the time I switch to using this product I have much less acne while my skin is not dry anymore I used this previously but started using a drugstore alternative that had basically all of the same ingredients After 6 months im back to using this Using the cheaper one gave me so many blackheads all over my face Im not sure what is in this that works but its awesome Im not sure if Murad Time Release cured my acne or the cleanser combined with my other skincare regimen did the work but my face is completely acne free Even that Im acne free I still keep murad in my regimen I am now on my fourth tube of time release cleanser Little backgroundAsian fair skin oily but dehydrated skin and very sensitive and acne prone skin My entire face was covered with acne beginning of last year And then I started murad time release because its much gentler on my skin and doesnt leave it dry I also incorporated hydraulic acid toner and barrier repair cream morning and night Korean mask sheets every other nights Now my face is smooth and acne free Thank you Murad I will always keep you as part of my skincare\\nread more Forever my favorite cleanser of all time Keeps the breAkouts away without overdrying my skin Love this product In less than a week seeing a noticeable difference in my cystic acne that nothing else has been able to make a dent in It also is kind

sensitive and acne prone skin My entire face was covered with acne beginning of last year And then I started murad time release because its much gentler on my skin and doesnt leave it dry I also

roses Also the product isnt too soapy I hate Nutrogenas soapy feel and residue and it takes off eye make up easily I use this product in the morning instead of washing my face and it is perfect I have a lot of melasma and dark spots  and this makes a huge difference in the brightness of my skin I will say that this definitely does not remove waterproof mascara so I wouldnt recommend as a makeup remover but in place of a second cleansing in the morning I absolutely recommend These are my favorite out of the sephora brand wipes I used to really love the green tea the pineapple the papaya coconut and the watermelon ones but then I finally got my hands on these after them being out if stock so many different times I am in love with these They feel so amazing and refreshing Gentle enough for the eye area as well I love these Absolutely repurchasing them more often These smell so good and work very well Would buy again I only used these wipes once and I love them It smells so good removes your makeup nicely and moisturizes your skin These gently get rid of the makeup day and ensure even when no other cleanser is used the face is clean and ready for rest and relaxation I absolutely love this product The beautiful rose fragrance and the super soft wipe is perfect These wipes completely remove your makeup and make your face feel so supple I cant be without this item Thank you Sephora for a wonderful makeup cleanser Im a cucumber kindofagal I cannot say enough about these wipes I have very very sensitive skin I have rosacea as well as a very strong allergy to Aloe I have to be careful of any products I use read all labels and believe me Ive tried a ton Not only do these wipes clear off a heavy layer of makeup and mascara but my skin feels refreshed clean and soft after I can name dozens of wipes that will make your skin feel sticky or tacky like there is a gross film layer but these literally make it soft and supple I strongly recommend these for anyone with sensitive skin rosacea dry or combination skin My dry patches on on my cheeks forehead and chin have greatly improved there are no more flakes redness has calmed and Im even using less moisturizer Long story short  they are completely worth their weight in gold\\nread more Amazing Gets my makeup off and my skin feels amazing These are my goto makeup wipes They smell great and are gentle on the face but still remove makeup effectively i love these hydrating wipes i have dry skin so these are very soothing yet affective Between the scent and the price point you cant beat these They are my go to before the gym face wipe I also love the smell of the watermelon ones These things are a GAME CHANGER Ive never used a wipe before this one that actually removed all my makeupincluding eye makeup Perfect first step to a double cleanse Or if Im feeling extra lazy I use two and my face feels so clean The rose scent is luxurious and these leave my dry skin feeling moisturized I love that these multitask While removing makeup is their main function they also help to target skin concerns I dont know what I did before these wipes\\nread more Extremely impressed with these wipes Ive tried drug store wipes and high end ones these dont disappoint I was a bit nervous about the scent irritating by skin and causing me to break out but after two weeks of using them mostly every day Ive encountered no issues I recommend these to anyone who has sensitive skin or dry skin theyre very moisturizing I am obsessed with these They leave my face feeling clean and give it a nice glow I live in Colorado and have dry skin I am able to use these and do not have to follow with a moisturizer afterwards all though sometimes I still do They also do not sting my sensitive face like many face wipes I have found do They are great for on the run or travel This is my all time favorite makeup cleansing wipes These wipes are very gentle and moisturizing while wiping away my many layers of makeup They are also well soaked and arent dry or dry out easily like many other wipes To top it off they are also inexpensive I use these to take my face makeup off after work before I go to the gym I love them for that because they do add a little bit of moisture to my very dry skin enough so I dont need to put any moisturizer on my face just to go sweat it all out or feel clogged They also brighten my skin The scent is strong but it doesnt irritate my VERY sensitive skin I dont typically use these on my eye but I do use them to wipe off my undereye concealer and they are gentle enough for that\\nread more This wipe is my favorite of all of them because of the way it makes my skin feel as well as the cleansing aspect Please do not ever discontinue this one Sephora These are the only face wipes I have tried and Ive tried a lot that adequately remove makeup without burning or irritating my skin They do wonders for sensitive skin but I believe theyd work for those who are oily dry and anything in between Im on my second packet now and dont plan on changing brands anytime soon They take off all my makeup and leave my skin feeling so soft They have a light natural rosy scent thats beautiful I havehad dry skin but using this everyday for almost a month has changed the way my skin feels Nicest toner I have ever used Well worth it Ive been using this toner for a couple of weeks now What I love about it most is that it does not dry out my super dry skin My husband uses it too and loves it Its not expensive and its a huge bottle 100 will purchase again if it ever runs out I have normal to oil skin and use it mornings after wash my face and my skin feels really good I use it direct on my skin without a pad This toner is amazing It has helped my skin so much and my skin is super sensitive Love it and its amazing for the price Great toner for hydration purposes only The texture is milky and absorption is quick It leaves the skin soft and hydrated Serums and oils glide on easily after prepped with this toner Great price point However if youre looking for a multitasking toner exfoliating brightening antioxidative this may not be for you Again strictly for hydration This toner has worked WONDERS on my face I have big visible pores on my cheeks and this toner has really resurfaced all of that I dont know exactly how it works but what I do know is that my face looks smoother younger and flawless once I put the makeup on  Same as the ultra facial cleanser from Kiehls this stuff is great for everyday use thats nothing super fancy but definitely does the trick Its almost a milky consistency which is very gentle for sensitive skin like mine and super hydrating Scent free for those who like that Most importantly it doesnt contain alcohol which is all I need in a toner to keep coming back for more This my second one I like it its good toner I used much more expensive toners and it have no differents with them Pros absorbs quickly into skin a little goes a very long way price is affordable skin is more hydrated even and smoother after constant and frequent use Cons after awhile your results plateau After using this toner for weeks on my combooily skin morning and night I have noticed improved hydration and more even skin tone Texture has been reduced as well Its gentle but does the job right Results are not spectacular but they are noticeable and the price for the amount you get cant be beat Especially for how long this can last even when using twice a day\\nread more This toner is super gentle and I love that it doesnt sting at all It gets rid of any tightness you might feel in your skin after washing your face and does not leave a sticky residue I do not think this product helps with oil control at all so if you are looking for that I would suggest a different toner or using other products with this toner that help My skin always felt so dry after washing it even though I was using a really gentle cleanser and a hydrating moisturizer Adding this toner in made a drastic difference If I dont use it before i moisturize my skin feels tight and dry I didnt realize a toner could make such a difference I love this toner I have really dry skin and this is so creamy and non drying My skin feels so refreshed after I use it Awesome Moisturizing and makes my pores disappear A great neutral toner I use this consistently and my skin feels smoother and more even I know i can count on this toner and will definitely buy again Excellent product It really removes all my make up and left me with a clean face sensation Love the smell too I love this cleanser If doesnt take much and lasts quite awhile For some crazy reason since Ive left SoCal the scent takes me home to Newport Beach Fashion Island Since I cleanse with Bioderma micellar water in the am Its not been drying for me at all Ive loved using this product to control my extremely oily skin Before I was told to use oil free products since my skin overly produces oil I gave this a shot because I use the allday balancing serum and had a great experience with that To begin you only need a rain drop of the product to use Its extremely dense which makes a little go a long way The odor smells so clean and fresh that it doesnt give you a headache  and truly leaves your skin feeling great Would recommend to anyone trying to get a new skincare routine  especially for oily skin\\nread more Amazing cleanser Ive tried to many and prefer the foam but it usually leaves my skin feeling dry This foams nicely great scent and doesnt dry my skin out at all I use this with my foreo and a little goes a long way I think its a great value for the product due to how little I would need to use Wow I bought the sampler kit for 75 and this is the BEST foaming face wash I have used so many other K brands and this one is the best I will not use another brand again this one is for life I love amorepacifics products especially this cleanser Its perfect because its not harsh yet cleans the skin effectively I just love the way my skin feels after I pair it with the moisturebound serum and hydra gel moisturizer and the new skincare regimen has been so good for keeping my acne at bay I will also say that the 4 oz lasts foreverrrrr seriously a little bit goes a long way I live in a tropical climate so it works for me to cleanse in both AMPM I use this in the morning and the enzyme cleansing powder in the evening Works well for me Love this cleanser Just a tiny amount easily dissolves all of my makeup and leaves my face feeling super clean but not dry  Very good cleaner Cleaned well and makes my skin feel great Love it A tiny bit goes a long way Leaves my face clean with drying it out Feels awesome after I use it So worth the price For a long time I refused to spend money for pricey cleansers choosing to spend more on the products I would leave on my skin instead Amorepacific made me change my ways I double cleanse using the oil cleanser followed by the cleansing foam and love how clean and fresh my skin feels after washing Gentle but effective And a little goes a very long way One of my favorite cleansers Ive been using this product for at least 8 years Its gentle enough for my sensitive skin Amorepacific is a great brand and I use a lot of their products Keeps my oily skin at bay and is a must have staple in my skin care routine Love Dont let the price deter you from trying this amazing cleanser I know its marketed for all skin types but I only would suggest it for combo or oily skin because its on that borderline of leaving your skin too dry I use about a peasized amount of cleanser and I feel like I have a huge face most of it my forehead lol and I get a great lather and full on cleanse for all this square footage of face My husband has normal skin and he uses this also but hes recently complained that he feels drier than usual therefore my caution above Ive been using this cleanser for about a year now and I havent had such soft clear skin before Sure my skin wasnt horrible before because Ive been using great skincare for 12 years now but this was a muchneeded upgrade in my routine I also use the AmorePacific cleansing oil for my double cleanse routine when I wear heavy andor water resistant makeup so when I do that this gets used second\\nread more My favorite face cleanser ever Smells great feels rich and moisturizing Lightly exfoliating My breakouts have reduced greatly Worth every penny I got this product as part of the Amore Pacific Kit Botanical Beauties offered in the beauty insider reward points and I fell in love with it It really works and leaves your skin super clean and smooth The exfoliator that comes also in the box is amazing please try it you wont regret I bought this cleanser for my fairly skeptical husband and he loves it I noticed his face looking brighter after just a few days and our family members have noticed that it even reduces the prominence of his acne scars The product itself feels very light and clean and Im looking forward to getting it for myself when my current cleanser runs out Amazing Removes all the oil and dirt Makes my face feel clean and fresh My go to wash Really removes makeup from your pores I do two washes to be sure if I have a heavier makeup day Doesnt overly dry skin Looks clean and refreshed after washing My absolute favorite cleanser Ever Periodt I can say this confidently because I have been repurchasing for a good 6 years So the love is real A small amount goes a long way and it does a superb job at cleansing the day away I cant ever get over the warming effect it has If you are looking for a new cleanser to try I recommend this one Best cleanser hands down The only cleanser that cleans every spec of makeup off I normally dont leave reviews but Ive repurchased this product too many times not to sing its praises Ive tried to buy more affordable brands wont put em on blast lol but I always end up discarding those and buying this I love how it warms up on my face and it gives a good amount of lather Smells clean but not strong like perfume I have oilycombo skin in the warmer months that goes dry in the winter and I use this cleanser all year long If you were on the fence go check it out You wont be disappointed\\nread more I have been struggling with acne for the past few years and didnt think anything would work to clear it up Ive been using this cleanser consistently for a few months now and am so incredibly happy I havent had any large breakouts and any small blackhead I get is super easy to extract So excited that I tried this product  This is the best cleaner for getting a cleaner skin after applying makeup Gets rid of all the residue  also mascara which used to be a big issue for me But for years Ive been using this product  it really helps This is crazy The warming effect feels so good and is a super weird feeling You need to try it out to experience this odd but cool feeling Its also really effective I have acne and I have tried a few products but none seem to work I am seeing a difference in my skin with this I also dont think this would work to well with dry skin I have always had really oily skin and after using this product it definitely got a little dry But overall I recommend it\\nread more I had tried this in a travel size and loved it This brand is super good I never leave reviews but had to for this one Prior to switching to this cleanser I was using Tatcha another Japanese skincare brand which I really wanted to love based on their ingredients and pretty packaging I wasnt sure if I was breaking out these past few months due to this cleanser or due to traveling so much as I tend to have sensitive skin in the sense that if I travel somewhere and sleep on sheets that arent mine it causes my face to break out I actually used Boscia in the past and loved it but obviously with all the different products out there and marketing hype its easy to get distracted Tired of breaking out and using tea tree oil with only somewhat moderate success I remember I had a travel size of this in my skincare closet The first time I used it my skin felt pretty dry so I used an oil to moisturize which I tend to normally do anyway Within the 24 hours holy crap my painful pimplesacne were going down and disappearing Ive used this product for less than a week but my skin has been rapidly clearing up Its amazing I get hyperpigmentation so Ill probably have to exfoliate or something to help reduce the dark marks but Im never straying cleansers again Boscia for the win\\nread more will never use another face wash Im so in love with it perfect for oily skin Love this product Ive suffered with acne prone skin all my adult life so I am very cautious of the products that I use After being on meds and proactive good product just not effective for when youre approaching the middle age mark I bought this product for weekend use when the makeup comes off and I wanted something softer on my skin to give my skin a rest from the daily beat Its amazingly cleansing and gentle I dont have any fear for breakouts and the blemishes I do have are not so pronounced I will definitely purchase this product again\\nread more Best exfoliator ever Love the way it makes my skin feel afterits like new soft skin I use it a couple times a week I just really love how my skin shines after using this product This is something that I will keep on buying This peel gel seriously saved me My whole life I had the worst oily yet dry and very flaky skin I would always have noticeable flakes on my nose and forehead area NOTHING helped it I mean I didnt really invest in skin care and I would try to go for the more affordable amazing products But now Im glad I made the choice to seriously invest Everything I picked out I did so much research on who wants to waste money when theyre buying a whole skincare routine at once and I dont regret any of it ESPECIALLY this one I will address the issues I see in some reviews Yes this is hard to wash off But its worth it Im not sure if it actually gets clumped in peach fuzz I purposely got a little in my eyebrow and scalp to test it out and it didnt cling to little hairs at all I seriously observed all of the action as Ive used this the past couple weeks and from what I can see Ive come to the conclusion that this product actually clumps up in my dead skin which is actually a good thing because it shows that its really clinging to it and doing great with removing it So that whole debate on if the little clumps are dead skin or the product itself I think its both So remember I said how my skin was this gross oily flaky texture Nothing would help it It got to the point where I was willing to use a washcloth to try and rub the flakes off and id scrub it pretty hard I was so sick of my skin that I was willing to damage it Which still didnt even help No exfoliations toners face cleansers nothing The very first night I used this the amount of clumps that I saw was insane they reduced over time as my skin came to lifeBut what was even more shocking was that once I rinsed this off literally ALL of my oiliness dryness and flakiness instantly vanished My skin immediately became baby smooth It was actually emotional for me because it was the best my skin has ever looked in my life My skin never gets annoyingly flaky now\\nread more This gel is satisfying to use because you can feel the dead skin pill up without irritating the skin too much I feel like a lot of the people that are giving this a low rating are the people that got mad when they found out that the pilling from this product wasnt actually dead skin but the product itself Once you look past that this stuff is amazing I always feel like after using this Ive gotten off that rough top layer of skin My face is always baby smooth after using this I just like to initially pat it all over my face leave it for a second and then start rubbing away\\nread more I recently started a job where I work in the sun for nearly 7 hours and forgot to reapply sunscreen one day Later that dat I had a burning sensation under my eyes and realized that I had gotten a sunburn in that spot So I started forming spots of dark drydead skin under my eyes I would scratch at it to try and get rid of it but its such a sensitive area and everything that I could think that might remove it was too abrasive Anyways I went into Sephora just looking for an exfoliator to deal with sebum and dry skin and an associate recommended this product to me At this point I had totally forgotten about the dead skin under my eyes until I used it and looked in the mirror and the dead skin was gone I wasnt even that excited to use this product at first but after I saw the results I couldnt believe this is what I had needed all along It was so gentle and worked so well Definitely going to buy a full size\\nread

think is amazing This one works better for my skin My skin has never been so clear I do have to take a facecloth to remove debris left on skin Im also using boscia makeupbreakup and purifying cleansing gel Im very happy with all three products Ive used this for years Not only can you see this working but it feels amazing afterwords If youre super dry like Ive been it can be used daily until necessary This is a staple product in my skin care so i got this somewhere else and I loved it must use a deep hydrating mask after does dry out your skin  Love this Does not irritate my skin and leaves it feeling so so smooth I also love that it is a clean product with no weird chemicals Love this product Really different feeling type of clean after using Feels like it sheds all of the dead skin off really good having sensitive skin in normal climes and now living in harsh Midwest winters my skin is extremely sensitive This product is AMAZING Absolutely no burning but does an excellent job of removing dead skin cells leaving only smooth and refreshed skin Dont let the reviews about pilling and getting caught in peach fuzz deter you from trying this product The peach fuzz balls remove easily with warm water and the more you use the product the less it gets caught in facial hair The pilling up is part of the exfoliant process  think of using balled up glue to remove residual glue and thats pretty much what happens with this product and your skin Again this product is AMAZING Try it\\nread more Best exfoliator ever Love the way it makes my skin feel afterits like new soft skin I use it a couple times a week I just really love how my skin shines after using this product This is something that I will keep on buying This peel gel seriously saved me My whole life I had the worst oily yet dry and very flaky skin I would always have noticeable flakes on my nose and forehead area NOTHING helped it I mean I didnt really invest in skin care and I would try to go for the more affordable amazing products But now Im glad I made the choice to seriously invest Everything I picked out I did so much research on who wants to waste money when theyre buying a whole skincare routine at once and I dont regret any of it ESPECIALLY this one I will address the issues I see in some reviews Yes this is hard to wash off But its worth it Im not sure if it actually gets clumped in peach fuzz I purposely got a little in my eyebrow and scalp to test it out and it didnt cling to little hairs at all I seriously observed all of the action as Ive used this the past couple weeks and from what I can see Ive come to the conclusion that this product actually clumps up in my dead skin which is actually a good thing because it shows that its really clinging to it and doing great with removing it So that whole debate on if the little clumps are dead skin or the product itself I think its both So remember I said how my skin was this gross oily flaky texture Nothing would help it It got to the point where I was willing to use a washcloth to try and rub the flakes off and id scrub it pretty hard I was so sick of my skin that I was willing to damage it Which still didnt even help No exfoliations toners face cleansers nothing The very first night I used this the amount of clumps that I saw was insane they reduced over time as my skin came to lifeBut what was even more shocking was that once I rinsed this off literally ALL of my oiliness dryness and flakiness instantly vanished My skin immediately became baby smooth It was actually emotional for me because it was the best my skin has ever looked in my life My skin never gets annoyingly flaky now\\nread more This gel is satisfying to use because you can feel the dead skin pill up without irritating the skin too much I feel like a lot of the people that are giving this a low rating are the people that got mad when they found out that the pilling from this product wasnt actually dead skin but the product itself Once you look past that this stuff is amazing I always feel like after using this Ive gotten off that rough top layer of skin My face is always baby smooth after using this I just like to initially pat it all over my face leave it for a second and then start rubbing away\\nread more I recently started a job where I work in the sun for nearly 7 hours and forgot to reapply sunscreen one day Later that dat I had a burning sensation under my eyes and realized that I had gotten a sunburn in that spot So I started forming spots of dark drydead skin under my eyes I would scratch at it to try and get rid of it but its such a sensitive area and everything that I could think that might remove it was too abrasive Anyways I went into Sephora just looking for an exfoliator to deal with sebum and dry skin and an associate recommended this product to me At this point I had totally forgotten about the dead skin under my eyes until I used it and looked in the mirror and the dead skin was gone I wasnt even that excited to use this product at first but after I saw the results I couldnt believe this is what I had needed all along It was so gentle and worked so well Definitely going to buy a full size\\nread more This was recommended to me while in the store and as a dry skin sufferer in Midwest winters it does make a big difference in removing flakey skin When I see dry patches

along with The Oridnary Niacinamide and Zinc serum for about 4 months now and my skin has never been better Ever since I hit my 30s I have been getting cystic acne on my chin and for almost 2 months now I have had zero cystic breakouts I did recently change from the butter cleanser to The Ordinarys squalane cleanser for a makeup remover but I will never ever stop buying this\\nread more Both me and my husband use this everyday I have super sensitive skin and most cleansers are too harsh for me This removes all my make up and leaves my skin feeling fresh without any stinging or redness A little goes a long way and so a bottle lasts for ages Ive used this when Im in a pinch and dont have my regular face wash It doesnt feel drying or like its stripping your face of everything My husband loves this stuff and is on his 4th bottle No break outs or redness with use Fair warning though neither of us break out with niacinamide however if you are sensitive do not purchase Niacinamide does to work for everyone Some do break out from it My husband loves this and he has been washing his face with a bar soap all this while I cringed and died a little inside when I found out so I bought him this out of a whim and hes on his second bottle now Great ingredient list nourishing and nondrying My husband has normal skin and not sensitive My brother always ask me to restock this for him whenever theres a VIB Rouge sale He swears this is the best cleanser he has used which helped with his acne and clearer skin He no longer have breakouts since using this He noticed a difference within weeks and have been using this day and night for 2 years now This is amazing Im sad jack blacks products are more geared towards men because theyre amazing I got a whole set of products for my man including this cleanser and I have to say its incredible This is better than any cleaner I own I just started using it one off day and it keeps my nice and clear I love it We will both be using this cleanser from now on Got this as a sample and had to buy the 16oz This is now my ultimate cleanser Use it as a morning cleanse and as a second cleanse after my oil cleanser in the evening Definitely does the job and keeps my acne prone skin calm Initially I wasnt so sure about shelling out 40 for a cleanser but the amount of product you get will probably last all year if youre only cleansing your face twice a day I only use half a pump as well not to be conservative but a full pump is too much for my face I love the good ingredients in this product plus being free of sulfates parabens unnecessary fragrances dyes etc The cleanser isnt super foamy or stripping but has a nice creamymilky consistency when a bit of water is added and is massaged onto the face In the morning my face feels clean and ready for the day after washing with this and applying the Jack Black Double Duty spf 20 moisturizer which also works well for me underneath my makeup In the evening after using a makeup wipe this cleanser gently cleans off my remaining makeup and my skin doesnt feel like its stripped of oils and dried out The smell isnt bad either fairly herbal due to the ingredients looking at you sage and rosemaries but not overwhelming and I enjoy it I always look forward to washing my face with this product All in all I will continue to use this product because of the amount you get for the price plus the way it performs and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to try a new cleanser Oh my only beef with it is the pump head popped off when I recieved it but it still works so it wasnt a big deal I would have been choked if the pump was totally broken though maybe they could up their game in how they ship this product so the pump doesnt break via shipping\\nread more I bought my bf this cleanser their moisturizer and scrub for xmas once and he has consistently repurchased all three products Jack Black is a great brand He has sensitive fair skin a natural blonde and has had no issues with most of their products I bought this product for my husband when he was having some sporadic breakouts After a few uses his face cleared up nicely I went into sephora to talk to someone about getting a cleanser that worked to remove the light daily makeup I wear for work I was told that there werent any cleansers did the job perfectly Id just have to accept a double cleanse routine of some sort Well lady you were WRONG I got a sample of this cleanser and two others to try out gave this one a go when I got home and there was nothing left on my skin when I went in afterwards with a micellar water No mascara no mineral foundation Wasnt super foamy and didnt leave my skin feeling really stripped afterwards which was nice wasnt exactly hydrating but better than a lot of foaming cleansers Ive tried Id guess this wouldnt take off everything if you wear lots of makeup but this absolutely exceeded my expectations\\nread more LOVE this product and I stand by it Will never use any other cleanser Didnt even make me break out or have an allergic reaction like most cleansers do Love the fresh smell and how clean my face feels afterwards My husband loves this product particularly in the winter when his skin is drier My only complaint is that this is the second Jack Black product sent mail order that has had a broken or missing part to the pump Would highly recommend that they package the pump separately in a box separate from the product with a lid on the bottle that can be replaced with the pump upon delivery Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it He was breaking out a bit just from not washing his face but ever since he started using this his face is clear I also use it when Im at his place Its not drying and doesnt leave your face feeling tight but also doesnt make it feel oily Perfect balance This is the only cleanser my husband uses I was buying the small bottle all the time I am happy it comes in a bigger size now I have oily skin along with severe acne and post acne marks and have been using this cleanser for 3 months Im not exaggerating when I say this product has helped my skin tremendously my skin texture improved so much that people where asking what products I have been using I havent had a major break out since using this besides the occasional pimple Trust me you will not regret buying this cleanser\\nread more My husband loves this face wash When I ran out of my other face wash I started using it too No residue or dry feeling left on skin Id definitely recommend this I bought this for my boyfriend last year and he uses it daily and has great skin It lasts a super long time too I only just now had to buy another one I got the larger size I really like that this product doesnt use parabens phthalates or sulfates too I was on the hunt for a great face cleanser for my husband prior to this he switched from Clinique to Lab Series and he just wasnt a fan therefore he wasnt really using the product So after much research and reading countless rave reviews on this product I was so relieved and impressed when I got him to switch and he also really enjoys using this cleanser So much so that I got curious and tried it myself Its a great simple cleanser that does the job I can see why my husband likes it Hes struggled with sensitive skin and breaks out of any excess oil on this skin but then using some of the products either dried out his skin and stripped off any moisture from his face I mean the struggle was real So this product along with its moisturizer have become his holy grail of facial routine Simple to the point and gets the job done\\nread more I bought this last year to get my skin in check for my wedding and it was great I struggle with acne and this really left my skin

this in the morning and at night Its done everything I could ask it to do Awesome I have acne prone areas all over my chin and around my mouth before using this product I would notice a new big

it makes your skin super soft and fresh it helps too if you dont get all your makeup off you can use it after taking off your makeup regularly and it helps get anything you missed I started using the Caudalie brand when I was in Paris about a year ago Ive tried numerous products and this is by far the best toner Ive ever used Im older and this works great I am on my 3rd bottle right now I have combination oily skin and breakout about once a month With this toner my skin feel so clean and fresh My skin gets so much better just because of this toner Cant have enough of caudalie Clarifies my skin has a soothing effect I like the smell too Would actually rate it 45 as it doesnt impart a glow to my skin as some of the other Caudalie products do I used to have terrible blackheads on my nose that caused so much skin texture Gross After using this my blackheads were GONE and my nose was so smooth Goodbye bumpy blackheads AMAZING PRODUCT I am acne prone and have been using this for almost two months I love it It tingles a bit after but this is due to the sal acid in the product I have a few toners but can say for sure I will be reordering this one It does help keep my skin clear Love this toner My skin is much clearer and less oily I was wondering if I should buy this product at first because of the previous reviews saying that it was too soapy and they didnt like the texture or they didnt see results However Im on my second bottle and I love it When applying it at night before bed Ive noticed my breakouts where less noticeable and were healing faster The soapy texture that everyone says they dont like about it doesnt bother me because yes when rubbing it in it does have a bit of a soapy feel but it drys smooth and the soapy feeling goes away leaving my face feeling fresh Plus the smell is nice\\nread more I was initially worried it might dry me out but it does the opposite My skin feels a little tight IMMEDIATELY after but as soon as I add my serum moisturizer etc that feeling subsided It smells clean and never irritates my skin not even the dry patches I tend to deal with in the winter This is one Ill keep repurchasing Love using this in my skincare routine  especially with the other products from the Vinopure line I have noticed a great improvement when using this and my Vinopure products on my skin consistently my skin used to be so unbalanced and oily As if nothing could stop the breakouts my makeup would slide off my face no matter what primer I used Then I bought the skincare kit with everything in this line and my skin completely changed No more cystic acne my skin texture is so soft and balanced makeup in place things healing well enough I go to work without makeup on pretty often So I am aware that there is alcohol in this toner and I am not a skincare expert so I cant speak about its long term effects But as an oily skinned person this toner is my favorite It feels really refreshing but also doesnt sting or burn It has made my face really clear Definitely put on a generous amount sunscreen after using this as it does make your face more sensitive to sunlight I have noticed I have gotten a few freckles more than usual near my hairline where my sunscreen cant reach \\nread more I love this product makes you feel so clean and hydrated Its vegan too I have been using this toner for over a year and I am very

I dont use them for makeup removal but sometimes as a second step after using micellar water I love them first thing in the morning instead of washing my face Super refreshing These are my favorite face wipes I love that it has a smooth side and a rougher side for exfoliation They remove all of my makeup I loved these What I noticed is that this one got off my makeup a lot better than the other wipes from this collection I had tried the grapefruit one before this Easy to use gets off my waterproof eyeliner too I like that I can get a light exfoliation with this too Will buy again Love this I got a sample with my last order and put it with the wipes I usually use to clean myself after my spinning classs It was wonderfully refreshing I personally love the scrubby side although it may be a bit rough for someone with sensitive skin Im usually sweaty and gross after my workout and want a good cleaning wipe and this is my new fave Im buying a pack right now D These wipes are AMAZING They get every spec of my full coverage make up off One side is a clean wipe the other is like sandpaper scraping away all of my dead skin cells and cleaning deep into my pores One wipe and done Ill never buy another exfoliating wipe ever again PLEASE DONT EVER DISCONTINUE THIS SEPHORA The best thing ever My face has never felt smoother Perfect before moisturizer I cant live without these I have tried every facial wipes on the planet From super cheap ones to ridiculously expensive ones The charcoal is one of my all time favorite ones I like the concept of using charcoal bc it is used for so many different things and one of the main things is absorption So not only does it absorb all the oils dirt makeup etc but it also has one side of the wipe that is used for Exfoliating So you can really get rid of deep ground in dirt I also like the Rose one as well For 8 bucks you cant beat it\\nread more These face wipes are great Convenient easy to use and they work well  especially at this price point Thank yo Sephora for a great product at a reasonable price On a side note the exfoliating side is pretty rough I have sensitive skin w mild rosacea so I just use the soft side But my husband loves the exfoliating side for his tough skin lol So yeah these will work well for many skin types depending on your personal preference Oh and I love how this package has a little resealable tab underneath the plastic lid that you see on the outside I dont throw that tab away I leave it on there to keep the wipes from drying out\\nread more I SWEAR by these Ive tried all kinds of face washes and spot creams and whatever to take my skin for he next level I didnt have HORRIBLE skin Just some mild acne and some congested pores on my nose and bits of dry skin especially around my nostrils and these wipes fixed EVERYTHING and I dont know how They exfoliate enough where i dont have dry skin that cakes my make up but they dont over exfoliate The pores on my nose have completely cleared up and begun to shrink And I RARELY get a pimple I keep packs of these hidden everywhere inside my coffee table night stand etc so the days where Im tempted to not do a FULL face wash and treatments I know Im at least using these and Ive never had a break out from having a lazy day or days and just using these Seriously worth every penny\\nread more Never knew I even needed these now I cant live without them Just use them 2 or 3 nights per week to exfoliate my face Leaves it noticeably smooth and fresh the next day These wipes are my absolute FAVORITE First of all they smell AMAZING Just fresh and clean and wonderful They exfoliate so easily and gently but I also feel like I can scrub the areas that need scrubbing I am addicted First ever cleanser that has ACTUALLY CLEANED my face  especially my problem areas I have only used it 2 days and saw results quickly I am not one to write reviews but this called for one Im in love with Sunday Riley This is probably the first cleanser I have used that made me say wow I have used so many cleansers over the years and I definitely know when I dont like something but never before did I actually feel like a cleanser made a huge positive difference after only one use My skin feels so nice and clean soft not tight hydrated and not oily I got a small size along with Good Genes will definitely recommend and repurchase full size Need only a small amount barely a pea for face and neck Highly impressed\\nread more I love to switch my products up but I always come back to this cleanser at some point WELL after my last cleanser totally messed up my face I am back to Ceramic Slip and NEVER LEAVING Truly my skin looked better less red and overall balanced within 2 uses Love this cleanser and the new packaging Of all the products Ive used this was a game changer a very gentle cleanser doesnt totally strip your skin leaves skin feeling soft and clean I havent tried the original formula but i am very happy with this product I am suffering from hormonal acne while being pregnant and i noticed a difference in my skin after a few times of using this Yes its not a miracle and it hasnt gotten rid of every blemish i have but this has helped a lot I will definitely repurchase this in the future No offense but i dont think it deserves all the hate with a lot of other reviews on here\\nread more Great product it makes my skin feel so clean afterwards without stripping its moisture or being harsh Its very gentle I use it as a second cleanser when I double cleanse to get deep in my pore without any irritation The only issue is the packaging it should be in a pump dispenser I am fairly new to Sunday Riley but have been very impressed with how my skin has responded to the new skin care regimen This cleanser is awesome It leaves my skin clean and firm and ready to absorb the moisturizer Love it For some stupid reason k decided to try another cleanser recently it was actually more expensive too huge mistake I will never forsake thee again Ceramic Slip Ive only ever used the new formula  I can say with complete certainty that its wonderful but maybe I dont know the true difference Anywho no smell doesnt foam too much  its gentle enough to be used night  day I doubt this product alone would remove a ton of makeup but hey thats why the makeup gods gave us Makeup Erasers  coconut oil right\\nread more I cant say enough about how much I love this cleanser I have been dealing with hormonal acne for over 2 years now My aesthetician told me I was overdoing it drying out my skin and over exfoliating This cleanser brought balance to my skin it does really cleanse but it never strips my skin plus it makes my skin glow Will definitely keep purchasing  This smells beautiful and leaves my skin silky soft and does not dry out my skin This exfoliator feels amazing it does a great job of removing all dead skin and my skin feels refreshed after using The smell is SO amazing I would rebuy it even if it doesnt work Its a light and refreshing smell Will definitely buy again Also reasonably priced for the amount Makes my face soooo smooth I cant stop touching it after using it Smells really nice and fresh The only thing I dont like is that it says to use twice a week and Im so tempted to use it everyday because my skin feels softer than a babys Im extremely acne prone and this did not cause any acne I feel as though it actually calmed some of the acne I had when I used it I am completely in shock and 100 satisfied I have been struggling with extreme oil dryness around my nose and ugly texture on my chin

works for my combo skin never feels tight or dry after using this in the shower my face is so soft 1010 recommend This was Great for when I was pregnant and had really oily skin with hormonal breakouts and texture However now that Im not pregnant anymore and Im back to my normal skin its a bit drying for me and caused some redness on my cheeks  I have sensitive skin on my cheeks I have tried neutrogenas exfoliator before It was horrible my face turned bright red with large lumps forming I decided I really needed to try out a different one as of more recently I have been flaking on my forehead I used this only once and after a few seconds of rubbing it in I saw dead skin rolling of my face I was so amazed I will admit I was scared because this exfoliant is a little rough but worth it After I rinsed my face I felt so smooth and soft I will be adding this to my skincare musts Im in LOVE\\nread more LOVE Really exfoliates and gives a smooth clean surface for masks toner and moisturizer My skin really absorbs all the moisturizer and I dont feel like I have a layer of grossness on my skin anymore Its drying and if you scrub too hard everything will burn pretty hardcore after Lightly exfoliated and used great moisturizer and I notice a difference already When I had foundation on I was able to see build up When I washed my face I couldnt see it I got this product to see if it helped with the deep cleaning It did more then what I expected with in the same week I noticed my T zone improving LOVEEEEE THIS i have oily acne prone uneven texture discoloration and even though after a scrub face can be a bit red it is not damaging not drying nor stripping Face feels smooth after and days on I use ever 23days Use it on my shoulders and chest due to this warm weather and sweat to help prevent any little pimp Sooooo good Gets in really deep I love it makes my skin feels really good and smooth Love Love Love  My skin comes out so smooth everytime I use it A really great exfoliant on the natural side Definitely read the instructions before using keep it away from eyes and should not massage into the face for more than thirty seconds to avoid irritation Other than that its great for all skin types and a little goes a long way so the product will last for a while I love this product the grains are large so if you press hard then it might irritate your skin but since you decide how hard you rub it into your skin it doesnt matter to me i liked the feeling of it and I think that it does a great job exfoliating and makes my skin feel bright and clean this is my favorite cleanser  i normally mixed this with kiehl calendula extract cleanser toocleanse skin effectively and less pores after using the product Love this I have 2 bottles of it and I use this as the first cleanser and than I also use another cleanser My skin feels great afterwards I have had no problem getting makeup off with this I also have not had any pimples with this Great product I recommend Love this stuff Ive been trying so many different products to get rid of little bumps on my face This worked after using it for 2 days I use it a few times a week and also use it as a mask Highly recommend this product This stuff if freakin amazing The scrubbiness is so gentle yet so effective And the light lather really makes your face feel clean I loved it so much I am no trying a number of other products from Kiehls I use it every morning in the shower and use Kiehls gentle facial cleanser with my evening skin care routine This very gently exfoliates your skin and cleans out your pores Its gentle enough for my sensitive skin and works well on my combination skin Love Love Love If your an oily skin girl like em then you must try it I love this cleanser Ive been using it for the past three months and I am obsessed Nice cream lather  its definitely helped combat my oil and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft The smell takes some time to get use to very clay but it quickly goes away I use this in combination with the rare earth clay mask and its a great combo I love the texture of this cleanser and the light exfoliation One of the best cleansers Ive ever used and I try a ton Soooo good Left my skin feeling hydrated and now dry like most scrubs And also the scrub was not too harsh great product didnt notice any exfoliant action specifically but doesnt aggravate my oily skin at all without being too astringent its moisturizing mild scent I highly recommend this face wash for daily use I have combination skin and have tried many face washes over the years This product doesnt leave the skin dry after each use and leaves a clean reduced pore skin instead This does exactly what it claims to do exfoliates  detoxifies It really does a good job of cleaning out the pores It is very gentle yet very effective I get really oily during the summer and I get a lot of blackheads This cleanser really helps mattify my face as well as go deep enough to clean my pores Its also very gentle and refreshing Im 32 and Ive had a problem with large pores my whole life not anymore and this cleans EVERYTHING off of my face Im on my third bottle of this stuff I tried to try something new and purchased the Dr Dennis Gross Cleanser the exfoliating one but I found it did not exfoliate my skin like this one The exfoliation is so subtle and not scrubbing your skin at all but its the perfect amount for my skins needs I tend to need frequent exfoliating otherwise ill get build up under my skin that wont come to the surface for weeks to months this completely got rid of those for me I tried the chemical exfoliating route as I heard its gentler but this beat it Highly recomend Skin Type is ComboNormal\\nread more Its an amazing product I had to use it for awhile until I finally started seeing results and The results are amazing like my skin feels amazing and I rarely have any acne around my jawline Both are in my lineup of favorite facial cleansers I have been using DE products for years and these are one of the few items I come back to time and time again They are gentle yet effective and the two mini bars last me a couple months I buy the minis simply because it is hard to pick a favorite between the two Small but mighty I LOVE these little bars They are concentrated with a silky cleanser that leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized not stripped of oils that other cleansers leave you feeling Theres no need to handle the bar too much it gives enough suds to take off my makeup nicely I did previously purchase the bars with the vinyl zipper holder but these will be refill for that The one bar is an exfoliating bar which is not harsh Great for travel I love Drunk Elephant\\nread more I really like the idea of these soaps bars Combating plastic waste is forward thinking for the beauty industry They are good quality dont dry out my face Its nice you can order the travel duo to see if its worth it without paying full price for the regular size Theyre definitely worth it Highly recommend I love these Both of them They work incredibly well and last a long time Im so happy to have found such a great cleanser without so much plastic involved Im buying the large sizes when these run out which will still be a while I wanted to wait until after I used this duo for about a month before I say if I like or dont like it Now that it has been a month I can honest to God say I LOVE THESE So gentle but my skin feels absolutely clean I use the JuJu in the morning and Peekee bar at night and I began noticing results almost immediately Also after washing my face with these my other skin care products began to absorb into my skin better My skin just feels happy and calm and looks so much better\\nread more cleans skin very well without leaving a dry feeling  I usually use the white bar twice as a double cleanse I was looking for a day and night cleanser that calmed my irritated winter skin This duo does the job The dark soap is for the am and it does make the sensitive eczema spots on my face a bit tingly and uncomfortable but once it washes away its fine It has exfoliants and that may be why The light bar is for night and is my favorite it doesnt irritate my sensitive patches I feel super clean and my face is clear and glowy Great price great products\\nread more Ive been using these DE bars for the last two years I always buy the minis because they last me quite a while Its nice to be able to switch between the bars depending on if I want a fresh wash or a deeper exfoliating wash when I need it I love these cleansing bars They make my face feel very clean without feeling dry I usually just wash my face at night after using an oil to break down my SPF and makeup but they are gentle enough when I want to use them in the morning Great for traveling Lasts a long time I will repurchase Before using this tonight I had dried skin on my face probably due to Sunday Rileys Good Genes I didnt want to exfoliate too soon so I waited a few days Makeup really looks like crap with dry skin But heres a picture right after rinsing Caudalie Very vulnerable  Love it Great exfoliating without being too harsh The best exfoliator out there My husband and I have been using it for years and we both love it When you find the perfect product no need to ever search for another amazing  truly exfoliates my skin and leaves so clean and smooth  my new holy grail only been using for a few days and ready getting compliments on my skin love love love  This has been my go to exfoliator for the past 4 years It is absolutely amazing and the only one that I could find that actually does its job So very pleased To me this product is a lifesaver You can see results after the very first use i would highly recommend this product to people who want to have clear clean skin  Feels so fresh on your skin and then afterwards your skin is super soft Deeply cleans but leaves face moisturized and soft not too rough I use this daily as my skin gets becomes dull quickly Its awesome for getting rid of dead skin and cleaning all the sweat and make up I am obsessed with this cleanser After I use it my skin feels minty fresh and is super soft and smooth The package is smaller than I anticipated but the product makes up for it I will definitely be repurchasing I love the way my skin feels after using this product There is a cooling effect at the end that is very refreshing My pores look smaller after using it Typical Caudalie smells amazing and does a great job It has very fine granules to gently slough off dead skin cells It has a slight tingling sensation but nothing major Another beautiful product from Caudalie I recently decided to invest in some skincare products to improve my skin I noticed that I didnt have an exfoliator to use I was a bit scared to buy one because in the past many exfoliators broke my face out But I needed one badly because my skin had so many dry patches and dead skin especially on my nose I needed something for sensitive skin and I bought this after reading the reviews on here Im glad I did Its perfect for sensitive skin and leaves my skin with a natural shine after Just make sure you dont rub it too hard onto your skin like I did the first I used it lol Also a little goes a long way I use this about twice a week NO MORE THAN THAT After each use I use RENs evercalm rescue mask They work great together Its pricey but worth it imo It removed all the dead skin I had\\nread more love this product it gave a new and finished tone on my dull and dark skin seems like facial is done by the professional I have eczema and the most drysensitive skin and this does not irritate it at all Yet it still deep cleans and REALLY exfoliates I will probably use this

YES FOR SENSITIVE  BREAKOUT PRONE SKIN I wear concealer contour blush highlight and setting powder and ONE wipe takes off all my makeup Gentle on your skin and the packaging is durable which is a plus for traveling I have the wipes in my work bag  the cleansing spa water bottle at home Its amazing This has to be the best cloths I ever used on my face It takes off my makeup so well Believe the hype The price is just too expensive for the amount of product you get Even though I love them I probably wont be repurchasing because of the price Ive been using Koh Gen Do spa cloths for over 6 years now and nothing else compares Are they expensive yes Are they worth it yes One cloth cleans your entire face eyes and all I hold and press lightly on my eyes for about 10 seconds and then gently work back and forth Takes it all off my eyes Then I use the clean areas to get the rest of my face Because of the expense I use these for travel only and get the large bottle of cleansing spa water for at home daily use\\nread more I hate how much I love these wipes KathleenLights talks about them in her empties and Sephora sale haul videos all the time the price is ridiculous dont get me wrong I have pretty oily skin and struggle with redness Most wipes leave my face feeling awful because theyre too abrasive but these wipes are my holy grail They take my makeup off no matter how much I have on It removes eyeliner mascara any lipstick etc I can use one wipe and get my face completely clean Theres no sticky residue it doesnt leave my face feeling stripped and the best part is it never ever

in a subscription box and I was ruined These are amazing They clean the face so well dont rub or tug no harsh smells and leave my skin feeling balanced clean and fresh So many face wipes leave me with a residue none here Other wipes also either dry me out too much or dont do enough to remove my excess oil I naturally have oilycombo skin these are perfect I feel clean but not stripped tight or dry Finished my free pack and bought 3 more\\nread more I purchased these specifically for travel as I dont like to use make up remover wipes They are terrific Thick not drying to the skin and do a great job of removing the makeup I already reordered as a travel frequently for business and this has become part of my travel essentials Convenient pack perfect for traveling I love using these cloths over makeup wipes Because these dont have that smell that makeup wipes do and they dont leave my face feeling gross These are thick cloths I just wish they were a bit softer and had a slight texture Received these from BoxyCharm At first i felt like who cares pretty much all makeup wipes are the same I was wrong While this isnt the most amazing product on the market theyre absolutely lovely My face never looked or felt so good  refreshed after using a wipe They take everything off feel incredibly refreshing  the cloth itself is SO SOFT I was so happy to have these on an overnight flight

the texture of this Left my skin feeling SO clean and soft Ive been looking for a good daily exfoliator and this is it Smells great Love the fine grit feeling Cleans skin perfectly Perfect for getting rid of makeup or oiliness I had gotten this cleanser as a sample and loved it Ever since I bought it my skin feels so soft and doesnt get oily as much anymore I highly recommend it My go to cleanser that i use every day exfoliates just the right amount Very recommend I have been using this for over 2 years now I used to use it only 23 times a week but have started it using 5 times or more as I have aged and find especially in the fallwinter my skin gets flakey I use it in the morning in the shower before I get ready for work and it leaves my skin super smooth before applying makeup I have recently found it isnt working as well so I think I may need to switch to something even deeper toe exfoliate maybe once per week But honestly I would recommend this to anyone A bottle lasts 34 months as well\\nread more I absolutely love this stuff The microbeads inside are not too irritating and the cleanser Is very good which I always expect from Clinique face products It is great for cleansing 23 times a week I feel that it leaves my skin truly clean I originally recieved this as a trial size and found that when I used it mainly when I traveled my skin loved this exfoliant gentle but gets the work done I decided to buy the full size and has lasted all year please note I do rotate between this and another regular cleanser The product is gellike with some grain type texture but as stated previously not super abrasive and if you have super dry patches where dead skin tends to cling this product WILL remove it\\nread more Perfect way to start my day I like that it exfoliates but is not

love this cleanser it feels amazing My skin has thee best glow When researching I was looking for a face wash that I could use every day to exfoliate but also clean out my pores and make them look smaller This is just that I dont think I will ever need another face wash after using this product It has very little scent too which I really like isnt too harsh of an exfoliant but definitely gets rid of all the dead skin on my face without over drying Such a great exfoliating cleanser Im pretty sure Im currently on my 4th bottle lol Im now on my 4th tube of this and I absolutely love it The granules in it are perfect so they arent too gentle that you dont feel that its doing anything but not so harsh that it hurts to use it My skin feels so soft and looks great after using it and I highly recommend it I love this product Ive always been weary of exfoliating because of how harsh it is on my skin Finally Ive found a product that not only exfoliates but gives a fantastic glow as well I truly see a difference in my skin I also love how u can use it daily without it being too harsh Totally buying this I really needed a reliable facial exfoliator to remove the remainder of hidden foundation on my face I enjoy Clinique products This works great for my oily skin Not harsh at all I have used this since the 1970s It isnt for people with skin that is dry at all My skin is an oil pit and this is amazing for it It contains salicylic acid as an exfoliant Many years ago I noticed that not only did it lift dirt and oil from my skin and keep it clear when I had a cold and got those rough red flakes around my nose it instantly lifted those and didnt even sting If you dont have super oily skin use a lower level of clarifying lotion They are quite specific Maybe one day Ill have to move down one or even two levels but at age 65 this still works for me\\nread more Awesome toner Clinique always knocks it out of the park Really pleased with this My skin looks smoother pores

skin feeling incredibly clean I also use this on my chest back and neck and Im amazed at what comes off This may be too strong for those with very sensitive skin so do your research Literally the best

I can even use it everyday which I normally cant do with exfoliants Great product Love this product line I also have the clay cleanser and alternate between the two If you have sensitive skin I highly recommend you give this product line a try Wow Hands down my holy grail discovery of 2019 The product is incredibly comforting and soothing from the instant it is used By itself it works extremely well to soothe redness and irritation This is absolutely bolstered using other products in the line I would describe the product as being milky smooth and lightly hydrating It is very easy to spread around the face erasing any chance of pulling or accidental physical exfoliation with your hands I double cleanse and do not use this to remove makeup so I cant speak to that element of the cleanser As someone with extremely sensitive skin and many of the issues that go along with this I have seen massive improvements in redness and inflammation since using this product It also works really well if I have a pimple or small breakout since it is so calming it drastically decreases the size and appearance of blemishes by reducing inflammation Another thing I love about this product is its packaging a lot of product comes in here and one full pump is exactly enough for perfect full coverage of the face I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive slightly dry skin\\nread more Very soft and gentle cleanser I use it after a harsh peel or microneedling session and the texture just feels great on my skin My boyfriend has rosacea and this cleanser has helped him a lot also I was a cult follower of Keihls cleansing milk until it was discontinued and since then I have been trying to find a comparable product Personally its a solid choice and I enjoy using it in rotation but its not my favorite cleanser Im giving it 5 starts for my parents early 60s who tried a sample I had and love it My biggest complaint is that I feel like it leaves a sort of film over my face when I get out of the shower but thats the reason my mom loves it She says its perfect for cleansing without drying out her skin What I love most about it is the super calming fragrance that I enjoy in all of RENs products I originally bought it for redness relief but I dont think it was very effective for that If you love cleansing milk or have dry skin this is a great choice\\nread more this is great for those who have rosacea i love using this cleanser and washing my face with cold water helps my redness tremendously its so gentle on the skin and leaves it feeling moisturized i 1010 recommend this product for those with sensitive skin my skin is very sensitive to heat sun hot shower warm beverages stress and certain foods basically rosacea after a long day it feels really nice to wash my face with this cleanser when i go to bed my skin doesnt feel itchy or like its burning its very soothing and calming to the skin\\nread more This product works wonders Made my skin so soft and radiant Would definitely be buying this again After months of trial and error exchanging products and reading reviews I became exhausted with my face At the advice of one of the helpful Sephora beauty advisors I decided to try the REN cleansing milk because I have very sensitive skin and needed a wash that wouldnt dry me out Since moving from the Midwest to the South a few years ago my skin has taken a drastic turn for the worse It went from normal to combination to oily to dry and sun damaged to poof add some hormonal acne My skin was an absolute nightmare until now After using the cleansing milk for only a few days my skin felt amazingly soft and looked alive again I also started using the overnight recovery balm at bedtime and the rescue mask twice a week and my blemishes are fading and my skin feels rejuvenated I finally found what works for me and can stop what seemed like an endless journey to find the perfect products 3\\nread more I looked for a cleanser forever and nothing feels as good as this I have rosacea and redness and sensitivity and this cleansing milk is the answer It is so soft and smooth and leaves my skin clean and happy It doesnt seem to be a deep clean but it is perfect for normal days and it does not irritate my skin at all Love this product I have dry acne prone skin this cleanser works really well for me My skin feels super hydrated after washing no tightness or irritation at all My face still feels clean afterwards despite it being so gentle and it seems to help with the minor redness I naturally have in the center of my face too This is a great cleanser with clean ingredients whats not to love I dont wear much makeup but this seems to remove what I do wear Great texture very gentle great size for the price I actually use four items of this REN line for my rosacea but this and the night balm are the two I could not do without Ive been using them for 2 months I cant say what my pictures with no make up on can say for themselves This has absolutely improved my complexion I use it daily in the AM True it does not take off waterproof mascara but I dont expect it to Wonderful for my red  rosaceay prone face Been using it daily for about 6 months An awesome neutral facial cleanser Removes makeup very easily and your face is so clean and soft afterwards I am slowly replacing my skincare regimen with all Ren one of the best brands that Sephora carries These wipes are awesome It takes everything off with out you having to rub and rub I Love It With the Take the Day of Balm its a perfect combination for cleansing Love this product Gives your face such a clean dewy glowing look and feel The micellar is the secret ingredient Worth the price I somehow like the wipes being thin compared to the sephora ones Removes makeup smoothly However if you are having a lazy day and just want to use this to remove makeup before sleep you still need to wash your face because its oily Takes my makeup off so easily and makes my skin super smooth and is very underpriced and it also works great with my sensitive skin Ive used so many different makeup wipes from Neutrogena to Shiseido and back Nothing removes all my makeup and doesnt strip the skins moisture like this one Its a great value for 50 wipes This is already my 4th purchase I will definitely continue to buy I have sensitive skin and I love these facial wipes Theyre great in taking off my makeup I still have to wash my face afterwards but thats a given Every other makeup removing wipes Ive ever used only make me breakout but these dont If you have sensitive skin these are the wipes to use Please follow with your daily night routine regardless of which wipes you usejs My favorite makeup remover wipes Ive tried them all from the drugstore Neutrogena to the fancier Ole ones and these are still my goto I actually prefer the smaller size of these wipes because it means you get more 50 wipes instead of the standard 25 and its nice for days you dont have a ton of makeup On really heavy days I use two but I can still make it work with just one if I use the right angles These are great I liked these so much I bought the balm as well I use these to wipe the balm and the days makeup away Good ingredients and good price I only use it for removing the bulk of my makeup or days where Im super lazy though I feel like this gets every little bit off Love it Ive been eyeballing this product for a week or so as my skin has noticeably aged last two years Ive seriously upgraded my skincare routine p product is allowing the proper time period to see positive effectsI went to Sephora to purchase some products I needed and asked for a sample of this why did I wait so long After one use I immediately noticed smoother healthier akinI am sold

for up to two minutes I then add my cleanser over top and foam it up so it rinses clean Follow with serum or other skin care products and they will sink in beautifully\\nread more As amazing easy and effective as this product is remember to not rub more than 2 minutes on the face if you have sensitve or dry skin  Its legit like getting microdermabrasion I cant see myself using anything else Used

difference right away This is also my first review ever and I only did it because Im so amazed D you wont regret it at all At first I did not like this and wanted to send it back but that is because I did not read the directions properly dumb me This product is best if you lightly pressed in circles all over your face for 12 min It takes time unlike harsher scrubs but it is very very effective when used properly I even used it daily for less time on my chin which gets congested Tube is still going strong for me after a lot of use over several month Really worth the buy for getting glowing skin for serums to go deeper and more often for congestion in certain areas\\nread more I was hesitant on purchasing this product because of the price but Im glad I did Ive tried many scrubs over the years

getting a professional facial my skin is super smooth after a little bit or redness This is a great exfoliator As usual Kiehls come through with a nononsense skincare product that I cant say one bad word about I like to switch between chemical and physical exfoliation My top two choices were this and another brand that was nearly twice as expensive and you get 5 ounces less As nice a job as that product does Id used a sample I went with Kiehls and so glad I did You get a LOT of product for the price and you only need slightly more than a peasized amount on your wet face for effective

you like chamomile I noticed a significant difference in my skin although I was cleaning my skin it was not getting rid of all the impurities until I implemented this toner I use in the morning and at night I originally got this from a friend who didnt want it used it without thinking much of it Smell wasnt my favorite but it didnt bother me so when I ran out I got a less expensive toner because its a step I dont care to spend a lot of money on Then I got pregnant my skin was pretty lack luster but I blamed it on the hormones My nose got perpetually red at the tip inflamed no matter what I did and makeup wasnt sitting well on my skin Thats when I was looking through pictures of the year before and noticing how amazing my skin had been and that the only major change I had made was the

skin wonderful smooth and effective essence  the real thing I saw an immediate effects on my skin supple and no more cracks in my foundation since my since was hydrated Previously I used Tatcha Essence and comparatively this works much better on my skin And the price is definitely a plus factor Ive been using this essence for nearly 20 years Im 41 now A bottle lasts a very long time Ive had a large bottle last over a year and a little goes a long way This essence has healed my lips removed colored spots from my mothers hands eased redness or other stress my skin experienced over the

regimen This has definetly upped my skin regimen I would invest in the bigger bottle next time Im only 14 of the bottle down You only need a little Applydirectly into palm and patty directly onto skin

Excellent Essence I love it They recommended it to me I use every day after moisturizing tonic Amazing this essence 55 Its really that lovely and luxurious Beautiful glass bottle is a plus Immediate results after 12 days Smoother skin and texture I highly recommend I used several bottles of this years ago But I had been using a brand that is like 3 or 4 times more expensive So I decided to try one bottle of this and I honestly think this works better Yup Im not exactly sure what this does but I love it It feels so nice on the skin It definitely adds something to it I love applying it on with my fingers It freshens up your skin makes it feel healthy and dewybut not oily I cannot skip this step in my AM and PM routine very good productcheaper than La mer but same fuction you should to try it My favourite essence for instant hydration My makeup application looks flawless when I use this essence It has a nice floral scent which I like but if you are sensitive to fragranced products I would recommend you to try it out at a store before purchasing because you do notice it A little goes a long way and I love applying it on my fresh cleansed skin My favourite way to apply it is applying the drops on my skin and gently using my hands warmth and pressure to let it get absorbed better Youll immediately see plumped glowy and hydrated skin I personally dont like the packaging because it is too bulky so I hope they repackage it one day The big red bottle is a very unique statement piece on my vanity but it also gives me a heart attack every time I almost drop it or push it over Its a little awkward to hold because of its rectangular shape I like trying out new skincare products all the time but whenever my skin needs a boost in hydration I always come back to this Id say if you are interested in Shiseidos skincare lineup you should definitely try this one I used to love all of Shiseidos products but so many of their new products are quite underwhelming and gimmicky Their timeless products like this essence and sunscreen are definitely a must try though I always recommend waiting at least 3 months for results with skincare products but I promise you that youll see a difference with this essence after one use Just remember to seal in the essence with a night cream\\nread more I cant say its Soso  cuz its really good This is the best essence I have ever

redness goes away  the skin looks even  smooth I got this in a travel size  definitely will be buying a full size My only concern is the bottle  getting the product out of the bottle can be a hassle

enough that I can really tell its helping to clear my congested skin I love this stuff I got it as a sample the first time and used it to the last drop And immediately bought more Just a small amount goes a long way and it really clears out the pores Great cleanser for oily congested acne prone skin The gentle exfoliate helps to clear skin imperfections My skin looks and feels great after using so affordable too My skin doesnt feel stripped or tight after I use this which is the key thing I look for in a cleanser since Im prone to dryness Ive been using this for several years and when I compare it against products Ive received samples of I like this better I love this face cleanser Its not harsh on my face I use it every morning I have really oily skin that is sensitive to certain things but my face loves this stuff Ive purchased this twice now both times for my husband but I end up using it Effective to take off makeup and the mask feature is really amazing I notice a difference every time My favorite cleanser I use this in the morning as I find its too drying for me twice a day It is great to clean out your pores and my face always feels super soft after I really really like this facial cleanser I received it as a free sample and used it mindlessly once I ran out of my usual fresh rose cleanser I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin and realized this cleanser was to credit Ill be purchasing this over my fresh cleanser from here on out After receiving a free sample of this Im obsessed and just had to order a full size tube I have dry very textured skin and Ive been struggling to find a facial cleanser that is cruelty free doesnt dry me out further and doesnt smell like a perfume shop This was a repurchase for me third time as Ive been using it for years Even though I use it almost everyday this tube lasts me 4 months or more A little goes a long way and I find it fantastic in managing oil and clearing my skin  so much so I bought another for my sibling and his face cleared up in a week Overall excellent Ive never used it as a mask but Im assuming it works just as well I never leave reviews but this product has helped my skin so much Last summer I had the worst skin unevenness texture and acne This product minimized each of those things by I would say 80 as I kept using it I definitely noticed a difference in my skin It was extremely helpful and even though this is for men women can use it as well I use this product every day in the shower as a cleanser and its super gentle a little goes a long way It has worked wonders on my dry and flaky skin I couldnt be happier with how soft and smooth my skin is now Amazing face wash  my pores have never been so small Leaves skin smooth and nicely exfoliated My husband got this in a Jack Black kit a few years ago but didnt use it so I did and was extremely impressed Not to mention its less expensive than the facial products that are marketed towards women Love it I used to get a lot of breakouts from clogged pores before switching to this cleanser its phenomenal For as potent as it is it really isnt very drying either My husband used this when he was having breakouts and reactions to his usual cleaner This product cleared up any blemishes quickly Great as a scrub and a mask Leaves skin soft Love this face washmask Doesnt over dry my skin I usually have oily skin but in winter it will get dried out periodically best cleanser Ive ever used and Ive used a lot I had never used JB products until recently and I could tell a major difference in my skin after a few uses Love this Its helped with the tiny hard bumps that nothing else touches Leaves your face so clean It can be drying so dont over do it if you have dry or sensitive skin if you suffer with little stubborn bumps that dont go away when youve tried everything YOU NEED THIS i suffered with these little bumps forever and tried so many products but nothing ever worked I pray this on my face before moisturizer and this magic took it all away This is legit magic in a bottle Helps acne and smooth sensitive skin too Best balancing toner for dryoily skin Use before bed and before moisturizer in the AM I love how it smells like real jasmine As soon as I spray my face I feel so fresh and ready to go I have very oily skin so this helps cut back and paired with the fenty primer I think its really working Would definitely buy again So after using 2 bottles of this already I finally can say this is the best toner I have ever used This toner has a very gentle smell to it for me I enjoy it kinda smells like rice grains I use this in the morning right after washing my face I have dry to normal skin So I tend to spray this on when my skin is still wet I dont use a cotton pad I spray it directly on and pat it in after After 2 bottles I notice my skin is not as red dry and flaky This has so many amazing ingredients that will do wonders to the skin I would recommend to those who have acne hormonal acne or a toner to use in general\\nread more I had read great reviews about this toner and was so excited to get in the mail Honestly my first impression was kinda disappointing but only because of the smell BUT its not a bad smell It smells just like green tea I dont know what I was expecting because duh ofcourse its going to smell like green tea So I kept using it for about a week just to see if it did anything And Im glad I did because I started to notice that my skin felt so balanced clean  comfortable right before applying my serum  moisturizer I only need to spray 3 to 4 times and never have to wipe any excess in with a cotton pad The spray component looks like a regular pump spray action but is surprisingly very fine and soft like a micro mist The glass bottle is so pretty I like to leave it out on the counter Overall Im so impressed with this product I have combo skin but would recommend this for all skin types too\\nread more Absolutely love this brand and especially this product Buying it all the time I really loved the smell and the feel when I use it I am prone to cystic acne with redness and this product helped myself with controlling it I used this along with Herbivores Glow Potion and I noticed my skin started to clear up after about a week of use Would highly recommend this product for those with redness acne or a combo of both Instantly moisturizes and calms skin for oiliness breakouts and dryness AMAZING smell and safe to use daily This must be a love it or hate it scent based on the comments but I LOVE the scent I havent been using this for long but I am less oily for SURE and the blemishes I had before I started this are clearing up nicely Love love love LOVE LOVE LOVE  this cleansing oil is amazing Ive been using it for over a year and it works wonders for my skin I have an oily Tzone and on most days I use this as my only cleanser but I double cleanse with it as well It doesnt have a strong scent lasts a long time and leaves my skin feeling hydrated Ive tried other cleansing oils like Biossance and found they break me out and left my skin feeling dry It has also never stung my eyes but I dont use it as my primary eye makeup remover If Im wearing waterproof makeup it will not remove it all but it will lossen it up and make it much easier to take off with a makeup remover\\nread more Hands down the best cleansing oil Ive used I would say its as good as the Tatcha Cleansing Oil but a little more budgetfriendly Its very light and washes off easily without leaving a film or residue on my face I sometimes use this alone when going from bare face days to makeup nights The smell is also quite nice very light I added this to my nighttime skin routine and I dont think Ill be getting rid of it Once again kiehls has a winner This stuff smells so good I am actually not a big fan of lavender but the scent is not overly potent It smells very fresh and dewy I use it all over my face and massage it for a minute or so before I get in the shower at night This gets rid of all my eye makeup without irritating my eyes I got this cleanser 5 months ago as a sample and after I used it I immediately loved it After I got it and it still hasnt run out It smells AMAZING and my skin glows right after I use it This is hands down the best cleansing oil Ive used I double cleanse so I use this first on my face dry to really break down makeup etc and then rinse and fu with a cleanser Its smells great thanks to the lavender oil and also contains squaline which leaves my skin feeling soft without tightness Highly recommend The best cleansing oil i have ever tried Ive tried so many cleansing oils and balms to remove my makeup but this one will always be the best one its not thick and does not leave a residue like many tend to and it washes off very easily It does not cause any eye irritation and your skin feels so soft afterwards Highly recommend it This a holy grail Ive used plenty of cleansing oil and nothing compares to this Im a full face type of girl too and nothing stands up to this It even removes highly pigmented eyeshadows that usually leave stains with ease I pair it with my makeup remover cloth and this seriously saves me so much time at night Getting low and will definitely repurchase time and time again I LOVE this oil it stared to double cleanse my face and it is amazing i used to remove my makeup and it literally melts the makeup and the eye lashes glue so you dont have to pull the lashes and take your natural lashes off Great product  bought it because I was having a tough time removing mineral sunscreen This did the trick It isnt too drying and also didnt cause breakouts So Ive discovered Im allergic to coconut oil and surprise SOO many oil cleansers have some trace of it in their products This is the only cleanser that will breakdown EVERYTHING before I go in with a second cleanser It never clogs my pores or leaves a residue In the winter on no makeup days Ill cleanse with this just because it leaves the slightest amount of moisturization on my skin Highly recommend for sensitive skin folks my eczema and cystic acne skin behind me\\nread more Ive been exploring other cleansing oils but I always come back to this one My skin LOVES it and it gets my daily makeup off Its that perfect texture that doesnt make you drag your fingers to work it in it just glides and breaks everything up I absolutely love it and after my last purchase I think Im going to stop jumping around and marry this thing I LOVE this stuff It makes my skin feel SO smooth and hydrated even though i just washed it I love the smell and silkiness of it I do normally take off my eye make up first but this helps to get every last bit of it washed off Totally recommend Love this product and the scent is my absolute favorite I use this mostly at night after Ive used a makeup wipe to get most of my makeup off My skin feels super soft and clean after I use it no greasy residue I have had the bottle for 6 months and its not even close to being empty Love this product completely takes off all makeup and melts it instantly When followed by a gel or foam face wash skin is perfectly clean and refreshed without feeling overly dry Worked great with my oily skin Fantastic for dry sensitive skin My skin usually revolts whenever I try something new however the first time I used this my skin felt soft moisturized and didnt have any breakouts or react in anyway My skin has rosacea and is very particular and sensitive to products but really responded so well to this I initially got the product in a beauty box as a sample size but purchased the full size nearly a week after I started looking at this product after falling in love with a sample of the Midnight Recovery Treatment Oil some time back I finally got a deluxe sample bottle of this to try and Im in love all over again This was everything I was hoping and expecting it to be This stuff takes off my makeup in no time especially any pesky mascara that is lingering It leaves my dry skin feeling clean and hydrated all at the same time Best of all It has that same amazing soothing herbal scent that all of Kiehls Midnight Recovery products have I only cleanse at night so this scent is perfect for a relaxing nighttime routine I have discovered my holy grail and will not think twice about buying the full size especially because it takes so little product to do the job the full size should last me a very long time I love you Kiehlsplease take my money\\nread more Ive tried many face scrubs and this one is by far my favorite I wouldnt use on sensitive skins This scrub works so well for shaving irritation Bought it for my bf and after just one use his irritation was significantly better He uses this just before he shaves and it works like a charm Highly recommend I know this scrub is targeted more toward the male population Ive heard other women say they liked it as well Tried it and enjoyed the cooling effect and its cleansing as well Will buy again Price is not bad either Best scrub out there I only use this twice a week but it works so well Love the scent I initally bought this for my boyfriend as over the past year I have gotten him hooked on all things Jack Black and this is the most recent purchase  but I LOVE IT TO So invigorating and also makes my skin SO SMOOTH I just bought another one since we are both using it I highly recommend for anyone Energizing is true This is that type of cleanser that gets really coldcool on your face It definitely wakes you up and does the exfoliating I need PS I am a female who purchased this and loves using it I was a bit worried it would be too harsh on my skin but it sure wasnt I rarely write reviews but felt compelled with this product I bought my husband a Jack Black kit this past Christmas and while hes obsessed with the regular face wash Love this scrub It is refreshing and cooling After washing my face I use this scrub and keep it on for a few minutes and then wash it off Skin does not feel stripped and feels so soft and awaken My bf loves this scrub It smells divine and is pretty scratchy Too scratchy for me but great for tough skin that needs a good scrub He consistently repurchases  great for a gift does its job well This product has a little tingly feeling when you apply it and will last few minutes after you washed your face It smells amazing very refreshing leaves your skin super smooth and clean I would definitely buy again I got this for my husband a couple of years ago but I use it too the scent is what I would describe as a bit masculine a sort of eucalyptus smell Very clean and refreshing It is an amazing face buffer even for sensitive skin I have very dry skin and this leave my face so soft and smooth Both my husband and I use this Smells amazing feels amazing and its got natural ingredients so its an all over win I have been using this face wash or 11 years now It has kept my skin clear glowing Obsessed I read up on this brand and after trying out so many different Jack Black tofu ya I am a firm believer I am a female and use the buff before my face wash to

this scrub and it controlled perfectly his sebum production It has mint and he loves the tangling sensation on his skin My husband loves this Was looking for something gritty Used to buy Clinique Mens Scrub before they changed the formula Likes this even more Also commented that he liked the scent even though this is normally something he would complain about Asked me to buy in bulk Bought this one for my boyfriend and he loves it It smells amazing too minty and citrusy This is an amazing and fine grained face scrub Its now the only one I use I also wanted to point out that Sephoras posted ingredient list is old This no longer contains polyethylene beads plastic beads It now uses bamboo powder So no fish oceans or aquatic life are damaged when the product goes down the drain Takes my makeup off with one wipe its amazing Also they dont burn my eyes like many of the other makeup wipes do Totally recommend Amazing So gentle on my sensitive skin Removes makeup and cleans my skin Love these facial cloths Great for sensitive skin Removes most of my make up before I wash my face I have been so pleased with all of philosophys products Love these so much They take off dirt oil and makeup in one convenient cloth I never travel without them The allone means that I pack less items and I dont have to worry about anything leaking in my bag Also great for lazy late night makeup

setting powder Worth the  Best wipes on the market Gentle and inoffensive almost fragrantless in sturdy packaging so they dont dry out One sheet usually enough to take off a face fill of makeup I have noticed a lot of the reviews are not so good about the quality of the cloth as there is not enough moisture on it I totally agree I just add a very very small amount of water to the cloth Run it under

toner truly makes them appear smaller My skin looks and feels better after using it I cant recommend this enough Use this along with the dash wash and moisturizer It took about a week for my skin to get used to it It initially burned and my skin became dry but with consistent use my face is so moisturized Its reduced my eye bags my smile lines and has controlled my breakouts all while helping my existing acne heal I ocasdionalky substitute the moisturizer for Ambi fade cream to tackle the stubborn dark spots and as a result have had to use less make up My is looking way better\\nread more I feel in love with this toner the second time I used it It really does make your skin look better and evens out the imperfections It was worth every penny I use it daily after I shower It is an excellent product This is AMAZING I first had this product used on me during a perk facial and fell in love It completely changed the look and feel of my face and décolletage I dont use it everyday

been doing wonders for me My skin is glowing This stuff is liquid gold Ive noticed my patchiness with my seasonal skin change disappear and my moisturizer melts into my skin and my makeup lays beautifully Love love love this toner I love this cleanser I dont use it every day because it would be too drying for my dry skin It definitely chemically exfoliates the next day I see a huge difference When mixed with water it runs down my arms while washing my face My solution is to rub it into my face dry like a mask then work water in and rinse This cleared up my acne that i had in the same spot for MONTHS I have scaring because the acne there was so stubborn but when I use this at night i notice the next morning it is lighter Nothing from the dermatologist worked on my skin at all

use once a week in the summer I use it about 3 times a week\\nread more Worth every penny I first used this when I slept over my friends dorm and I remember seeing an improvement in my acne the next morning However it wasnt until last week when I actually remembered about it and decided to buy my own For the past year or so I have had nonstop acne on my cheeks which Ive been unable to control The top photos are from May 30th and the bottoms ones are today June 8th and ALL my acne is gone from using this product The only thing I have left is some scaring Which will hopefully fade before too long For the first time in years I left the house without feeling like I had to cover my face with a hat if I wasnt wearing makeup I will say after a week of using this product every day my skin has started to feel very dry around my nose and mouth so going forward I plan on only using this every 3 or 4 days now that its done the work getting rid of all my breakouts Will definitely be buying more from this line\\nread more Great cleanser Exfoliating and cleansing in one Cleared all of my clogged pores I did go through a purging stage and about 2 weeks later it was cleared I only use at night

and pores I fell in love I use this after a gentle cleanser to remove most of my makeup currently using Youth to the People Kale  Green Tea Spinach Vitamins Superfood Cleanser and LOVE it But also have used it prior with Drunk Elephant Ive also used it with my hands and clarisonic and both give amazing results For anyone with bad skin texture uneven skin and problems with pores this is your product My skin feels so smooth now and my makeup goes on so much better I use this 12x a day but always at night and follow with Belif The True Cream Aqua Bomb I have never been happier with a skincare product\\nread more Ive been using this product for about 8 months and I like it I use it several times per week and it keeps my skin smooth and clean I like that there is almost no scent and that you only need a small drop to get the job done The bottle is very big and long lasting this is my first PTR product and I love it  I thought at first it was going to be to rough but I adapted nicely Im using it about 3 days out of the week and this is going on week 3 and the results are worth the buck This face wash is my absolute favorite It cleans very well and removes all makeup Plus it really clears your skin and makes it look super youthful Highly recommend This has dramatically improved my acne and acne scars A little goes a long way and you get a huge bottle  Oh my goddd I wish I would have found this stuff ten years ago Holy crap does it work well too I have literally only been using it for a few days and I can see and feel a huge difference My skin looks younger and refreshed I have found it to be rather gentle I have been using it twice a day for about a week now and so far so good My pores a visibly smaller and less noticeable My skin looks more taut I love it Botox in a bottle\\nread more Hands down my all time favorite cleanser My skin feels super clean without feeling dry Ive noticed a difference in my fine lines and my skin tone appears much more even I had been using the Murad acne line which is amazing because I stopped using his AACG I dont use products with parabens The Sephora employee said I didnt want anything with dyes anywaytheyre really bad for the skin I stopped using the murad acne was because I started having breakouts again after using the product for about 2 years I guess i got tolerant to it The employee recommended this and its been amazing ever since I still use the other products in the murad line but switching up the face wash really helped This does everything it says it will do\\nread more This has changed my skin and my self esteem in an amazing way I have never gotten compliments on my skin until using this If you have textured skin or acne prone skin you need this in your life I cant praise this product enough Since it is an acid make sure you use a toner and a sunscreen The bottle used to be clear with a clack cap and directed you to wash for 1 minute and rinse with cool water Im hopelessly devoted\\nread more Great for sensitive skin I have oily acneic skin and EVERYTHING breaks me out This is gentle and effective at the same time Highly recommend LOVE LOVE LOVE boscia blotting sheets My face gets super oily throughout the day If you want to remove the shine and dirty feel without removing any of makeup boscia sheets are the way to go I like these blotting linens I used a lot of different ones but these ones are probably the best Exactly what I expected Works well even with makeup on And a friendly price I love these Not only do they get rid of all the excess oil on your face but they smell really good These work great and smell yummynot overpowering Kept the shine off longer I wish I could provide more stars I love these Im so upset Sephora has discontinued selling it Having oily skin and living in the Arizona heat these have been AMAZING I carry this in my backpack and purse and they come in handy anywhere Im able to do my whole face on both sides with the oils on my nose forehead and upper lip area Also love that you can see the oils being absorbed and you get so many for such a small price Definitely recommend Absolutely love these They are a must have if you get shiny mid day I cant live without them in my land of summer humidity They are a bit pricey but I use less of them than other brands because they absorb so well My favorite oil blotting tissues I like everything charcoal because its neat to use a black item The tissue has a mild fresh scent and takes away the shine The fascination of seeing the how much oil is absorbed by the tiny tissues On stressful days I need to use 2 tissues Love these bigger than average so I only need one These literally smell amazing and soak up ALL the oil on my face I use these with a full face of makeup as well The trick is to lightly blot the oily areas Doing so no makeup will be removed simply the layer of oil Love that about these Oh and the price What a steal 100 sheets for only ten dollars Ive been buying these for years My face is an oil slick but these are so big I only need to use one at a time I love that these only use natural and minimal ingredients Ive even gotten my boyfriend to buy them for himself so he can stop stealing mine We swear by these Since youd be using 2 or 3 sheets from a cheaper brand anyway these are worth the money 100  Tried many blotting papers but I always come back to these They are great Absorb really well and dont smudge makeup One sheet is enough for the whole face Will always recommend Amazing blotters The only ones I buy Does not smudge or remove make up with use Works great and doesnt take the makeup off My face feel so clean after I use this product and unlike many products it doesnt make my skin break out It feels terrific Great cleanser for oily skin in the summer It doesnt dry me out and it feels squeaky clean afterwards What I love most about it is the smell and how it didnt break me out I have been using this cleanser for 10 years I use it now with my Clarisonic and it is the perfect combo Deep clean without stripping the skin Everytime I try a new cleanser I always come back to this one  I have super dry skin especially going into the winter and this product is super soothing and cleansing It leaves my skin feeling even and clean and after trying everything from cerave to vichy this is what ive been looking for  Also a bottle lasted me almost 6 months so great value as well Good for my sensitive and combinaison skin Great all year long I have an acne prone oily skin and this cleanser works great for my skin I use it every other day since it is a soap based stripping cleanser so can be a little harsh if used daily But it has cleaned my skin thoroughly and I have very occasional acne issues after I started using this Perfect balance Cleanses without stripping my mid 40s skin Removes all makeup  leaves my skin prepped  ready for serumstreatmentsmoisturizer The best cleanser ever Highly recommend Way better than many more expensive cleansers It gives you the real feeling that your skin is clean This is by far the best cleanser Ive ever used  It doesnt take much of product to produce foam and it is affordable for the quality I have a VERY sensitive skin and it suits me well  Try it you will not regret it  This takes off every inch of my makeup I have white towels and when I dry off my face after using this my towel remains completely white Its not even that expensive and the tube lasts forever My skin is very sensitive when it comes to face washes and this really is perfect Before you read this review keep in mind I have no acne issues with fairly clear skin Id say this work best for lighting dark spots from old pimples and creating an even tone This face wash is everything I have incredibly dry skin especially in the morning winters and this literally saved my skin after the first use I have purely good things to say about this product not to mention the price matches the amount your getting unlike some of these other higher end products Its a really good facewash overall which I highly recommend to anyone who needs moisture in their skin and wants an even skin tone\\nread more I really like this cleanser I wanted something that was gentle that wouldnt irritate dry or leave my my skin feeling greasy This is it  the scent is SO lovely and my skin feels great I recommend this for anyone looking for a face wash who has sensitive skin I love this product I have struggled with acne from stress from school for a while now and this was just what I needed It makes my skin feel squeaky clean but

this cleanser Leaves you feeling clean without drying out the skin  I have sensitive skin and it didnt make me break out Great cleanser This one can be my top 3 favorites Product does what it says Doesnt bother eyes when used Ive been using this for many years Its gentle enough to use even with my contacts on and I also use this to correct little eye makeup mistakes I have been using this for

other products for fun but this is an absolute staple in my skincare routine and always will be  it should be yours too I love this exfoliator I actually use it a little different than some would but I feel that gives me the best results I make sure I have cleaned my face then I put the exfoliator on but not while my skin is soaking wet I like to feel the grains Then I just wipe it off I get a better result this way as doing it with a full wet face I dont feel like its exfoliating anything with the ever present debate on scrubbing everyday i do everyday with this every morning and i love it its not a heavy scrub gentle enough for every morning use My daughter loves this Its a classic staple for anyone This product has been a staple in my skin care routine since I was 15 Im 43 now No other scrub does a better job I Love This Ive been using it since the beginning go the year yes this small bottle goes a long way It isnt too harsh on my face and makes it feel clean afterwards My only advice would be to NOT use this twice a day I use it at night to really get the rest of my makeup get the makeup wipe missed followed by toner a facial mist and moisturizer In the mornings however I tend to skip any cleansing and go right to toner to avoid scrubbing too many nutrients out of my skin and causing microtears\\nread more I got this in a gift set needing some skin care

have tried several other scrubs I always come back to this one CLINIQUE7 Day Scrub Cream RinseOff Formula is a great micro scrub to use on a precleansed no makeup face and prior to makeup application to smooth away any dullness or dead skin on the surface I use this in combination with a benzoyl peroxide cleanser for acne prone skin please be careful mixing products wsensitive skin This clinique

secret for having soft lips in the middle of winter The granules are smaller than sugar and are more uniform This is cheaper than the Fresh Sugar Lip Polish and you get 5x more product made my face super smooth and is very affordable What more can you ask for This is the best most consistent exfoliator you will use Perfectly formed beads that you can feel but not irritate This is my go to  every other day scrub I keep it in the shower which works perfectly to rinse off for smooth glowing skin I have very sensitive skin with patches of roseaca but it does the job without irritation Love Ive

Cleanser Moisturizer and Eye Cream A Small but significant MIRACLE My skin is firmer silky to the touch and far more radiant The Softner is luxurious and I believe allows your skin to absorb the next product fully In addition it does remove any excess makeup left behind I am SOLD I was recommended this moisturizer by my dermatologist because i couldnt find one that wouldnt cause my skin to get extra oily and breakout horribly I was a little skeptical at first but now i wouldnt trade this product for anything else Ive had a few other friends try it and they love it as much as i do My mother also tried it and loved it This is definitely a household favorite Always used the Ibuki Softener but Shiseido no longer makes it so I tried this one and I wasnt disappointed Leaves my skin soft My face loves it On a hot summer day sometime just this without moisturizer is enough Love Shiseido and this product I repurchases the item for several time It soften and hydrate my skin I love the fragrance of Shiseido product line But if you have sensitive skin please get a sample before purchasing the full size wonderful preserum prep purchased in March 2018 its Feb 2019 Im a little below half the 10 oz it hydrates a great amount dont use cotton pad is a waste and absorbs too much just pour nickelsize amount on hand Make my skin feel so soft and hydrated This toner is very refreshing and hydrating I love using this before I apply my daily serum and moisturizer It helps lock in the moisturizer for a long lasting moisture look and feel I absolutely love this product It leaves my skin feeling so smooth Even if my skin be sensitive to certain products this one was very gentle on my skin This toner is wonderful Its supple and creamy against the skin without the worry of clogging pores It has enough moisture to be used on its own when youre out of your favorite moisturizer This really does soften my skin Its amazing as a matter of fact It is described as a toner and I use it as such but I think it is actually more of an essence I suppose you can use it for both  I splash it on rather than apply it to cotton and may try it in a spray bottle I follow with SK II essence but thinking this might not be necessary I love the SK II but is there such a thing as too much of a good thing I really dont know All I know is that my skin looks and feels amazing Now if I could only

My skin feels soft and not tight at all but clean This deserves way more hype I bought this product for a really random reason I was trying out some longlasting lipsticks on my hand at Sephora and had a hard time wiping them off As I was walking around I decided to try some of this remover to wipe off my hand I put a dab on a damp cotton square and wow my hand was completely clean after a couple of quick swipes I bought it immediately and for several months I used it just as an eye and lip makeup remover in the same fashionputting a pump on a damp swab and swiping off stubborn makeup However I recently started pumping onto my fingers and gently rubbing onto my face directly and the results are even better I now use it all over my face by rubbing it straight in and washing off with water My skin feels amazing afterwardssoft and supple My mom recently tried it too on my recommendation due to her skin feeling dry after makeup wipes and she is now hooked This is a fantastic makeup remover but best of all it really makes skin feel better after each use\\nread more I bought this a few months ago but finally got a chance to open it My all time favorite cleanser is the normal soy face

more harsh treatment Highly recommend especially if you love the fresh soy cleansers Totally love this product So soft I also love the smell Realized the proper way to use it since my last review make sure skin is completely dry when applying I love this product I have extremely sensitive skin and have always had a hard time finding a gentle yet effective cleanser It is milky and creamy no foam A I always try and branch out by buying different cleansers whether it be luxury or drugstore and this one is always the one I run back to it takes off makeup leaves the skin feeling incredible and it doesnt break me out I have more sensitive skin and it doesnt feel burning at all its so soft Im surprised how how I love this product It took a minute to past the initial weirdness that I dont wash my face the traditional way anymore but Ive been getting a lot of unsolicited comments on how good my skin looks Love love this product  Very easy to use and does it job well I got this as the sample with my beauty points and I am super impressed with this product It smells so nice and its super light yet it still pulls out so much dirt from my face its crazy Ill definitely be buying this now that

and I love this stuff I always break out when I am pmsing I have used this every day and my face is clear for the first time in my life At first I wasnt up for the new formula mostly due to the scent but after trying it for a couple of weeks its still great I use this in the morning to lightly cleanse my face  deep cleanse regimen is at night My face havent reacted bad to it and it cleanses just as well The reviews for the reformulation are so surprising to me that I had to sign up just to rate this product and share my experience Im not in the beauty industry and I dont know anyone who works in it Im just a huge fan of skincare and makeup with clean safe ingredients I have used this product for over 2 years as my exclusive second cleanser following my oil cleanser which I use if I wear any makeup or sunscreen and both formulas have been fantastic Tbh I havent noticed a real difference between the formulas The other reviewer who called out that the ingredient list is spot on if you run the new ingredient list through something like CosDNA and analyze the ingredients it is extremely clean Its an incredibly effective cleanser and gets off all makeup residue and most importantly it doesnt burn your eyes when youre using it to clean off mascaraeyelinerwhatever youve got going on Ive tried 10 of the highest rated micellar waters from high end to all natural and Dr Jart is hands down the most effective has the cleanest ingredient list and leaves your skin feeling clean without stripping it or leaving a weird residue This is one of my holy grail products and I dont see that changing anytime soon\\nread more This product is so awesome it removed all my make up the IG glam layered baked makeup with out any problems My skin feels soft  clean and moisturized Dermaclear Microwater is the best cleansing water I have ever used I wear contacts and have sensitive eyes This cleanser is also great on my face I love that I dont have to use a separate toner if I dont want to It makes my skin brighter too A musthave always that does everything Best micellar water Ive ever tried It removes all my makeup and even my lash glue which is almost impossible to remove Definitely would recommend i dont wear makeup often but im very lazy to fully wash my face with a cleanser sometimes so this is a great product to use especially if you are on the go Not sure how this has such a low rating others are comparing it to the old formula and while yes it has a citrus sent now it has better and cleaner ingredients than the old formula The old formula had SO many unnecessary ingredients in it and the ingredient list has been substantially shortened in this new formula This stuff is amazing I would say equally as amazing as the old formula as I have used both and prefer this formula Its soft gentle doesnt burn my eyes smells clean and lasts a long time Ive used this formula and the old formula to take off makeup on clients as well and I see no difference other than the ingredients I recommend this to everyone\\nread more I also use this with my Clarisonic and love the results very clean skin very smooth without over dryingWhen i use my toner i have nothing left

little bit of a bigger skincare budget I love this cleanser It smells heavenly cleans so well and helps manage my breakouts Is it the best gel cleanser Ive used Definitely It lasts me about 9 months you only need half a pump for your whole face and I look forward to cleansing every morning and night But at the end of the day it is a luxurious gel cleanser If I had to go on a still strict budget I would spend it on the soft cream and treatment lotion both which are life changing If you can afford this cleanser its lovely But its not the best of the la mer line if youre on a budget I will continue using this as long as I can afford it\\nread more The cleansing gel is great I use it in conjunction with the cleansing oil and its fabulous It lasts forever and leaves skin clean and does

purchase it BEST DECISION EVER My oily skin GONE I have seen some reviews that say after applying their skin looks more oily but you just have to let it really take into effect It also does not dry my

It smells weird at first sickeningly fruity but you get used to it These are only 4 and they are literally the best blotting papers Ive ever tried They dont push my makeup around and they still manage to keep me from looking oily Absolutely love Love them and great price on sale for 4 I buy all the sephora blotting papers but the green tea and rose are my favorite Great job soaking up excess oil without removing or smudging my makeup My only gripe is that they are constantly out of stock Im a fan of these blotting sheets They keep my skin oil free for longer than other sheets Ive tried They are thicker than other brands which is a plus The only minor thing is that they are hard to separate Will purchase again I really like these blotting papers They dont seem to take off makeup when you blot the way so many of them do The packaging simple but convenient You dont have to wrestle with the sheets to pull them out Personally I like the smell and dont find it overpowering But I can see how someone who is sensitive to smells would Love this paper It clears away my oil but it doesnt leave my skin dry It also leaves behind the rose pedal fragrance They work as well as any more expensive version Ignore Bosca and Tatchs Theyre overpriced and work no better I like blotting sheets without talc mineral oil etc The tea tree attracted me for its antibacterial properties It also smells sooo good These are a great size and my combooily acne prone skin is instantly mattified when I use them They absorb oil so well The sheet really sticks to your skin like a magnet And I usually only need one sheet Excellent value for 100 sheets Ill definitely be trying the rose snd charcoal too\\nread more Gets ALL oil off I can already tell its improved my skin I have a very oily tzone These papers are perfect for blotting away the shine And the price is pretty good when compared to name brand blotting papers Shiseido Tatcha I have a very oily tzone These papers are perfect for blotting away the shine And the price is pretty good when compared to name brand blotting papers Shiseido Tatcha I have fairly oily highshine skin and Ive tried Papier Poudre Tatcha Boscia and other brands and these are simply my favorite The smell is refreshing but doesnt linger The texture feels cool on my face The papers gently sponge away oil leaving a markedly more matte face What more can you ask for I keep a pack in the office the bedroom and in my purse They are especially good for just before a highstress meeting at the end of an already full dayits nice to look polished again and not feel shiny\\nread more These blotting papers are very effective on my oily skin I appreciate that one sheet does the job compared to typically my needing 2 sheets from other brands The price is great as well and the packaging makes it easy to dispense one sheet These are great  they do exactly what they say theyll do I actually like these better than the boscia charcoal blotting papers I thought it wasnt going to blot anything on my face and leave a little oiliness behind but it actually got everything and left my makeup alone The only thing I didnt like is the packaging if your not careful you can easily take out 3 papers at once but Im still repurchasing cause the papers are effective and cheap takes away the shine keeps the makeup on These work perfectly the container is durable and they stay clean Awesome product Works really well and soaks up a ton of oil I use one of these at the end of the day and it completely mattifies my skin and makes it feel a lot less greasy I think it works a lot better than the more pricey Boscia ones Just wish they were bigger itd feel more luxurious and I end up using two each time anyway I have repurchased this cleaner at least four times and love it For me it removes every trace of makeup and leaves my face super clean I switched to this cleanser because I have hormonal acne since using I have not had 1 breakout and my skin is clear The only issue is that its drying I use a rich moisturizer after so no dry patches or uncomfortable tightness My skin type is combination and sensitive It lasts a long time because you only need a pea sized amount for a rich lather I would try a sample first for dry sensitive skin because it may be too harsh for this skin type\\nread more My holy grail This is my favorite cleanser I will occasionally switch to another face cleanser to mix it up and see if I like something better but I always regret it and go back to this one My combo skin thanks me for it when I go back to it It is such a clean fresh feeling Doesnt leave a funny residue on my skin and I have noticed a positive difference in my pores being smaller and less oil production in my TZone So far so good Ive been using it for about 2 weeks I have combination skin a little oily in tzone and normal in other areas I use this with my clarisonic My first impression was that it didnt feel as if it was cleaning my skin but once I rinsed it off and dried my face my skin felt so clean Hours later my skin still looked so fresh and the only areas looked less oily Its the first time I purchase this cleanser and Im very happy with it I like to switch them up often and I use a pre cleanse before I use this cleanser I would definitely recommend to combinationnormal skin Even without the clarisonic my skin still felt fresh and clean after use\\nread more I am sooooo happy I took a chance on this face wash I had never heard of the brand before  didnt really know where to start to look for a great anti aging face wash but

makeup gently I tried a lot of different oils and balms and they always burn my eyes so much and this product never does Overall great I love this cleansing oil I am on my second bottle of it I use 2 pumps each night It removes all of my makeup including mascara without irritating my skin or eyes A little pricey but It only takes two or three pumps to remove a cake face a bottle can last for a long time Doesnt leave any greasy residue best makeup remover ever period This product is AMAZING It removed all makeup without irritating my skineyes It is gentle but removes even longwearing eye makeup Ive tried similar products and this is the best for me and my sensitive skin My only suggestion is that Fresh make a travel size I love this Its the best at breaking up waterproof makeup and sunblock Its very thin and you will need to mix with a bit of water to activate the spread of it I will definitely be buying this again This is perfect for removing makeup as a first cleanse it fully removes all my eye makeup without stinging my eyes it really does such a great job I could use this alone without a second cleanser Great makeup remover Doesnt leave me feeling greasy but does make my skin feel hydrated after using Ive been using the oil cleansing method for years but initially got this for traveling and ease of packing I love that you can twist it closed securely It smells lovely and removes my makeup completely leaving my skin soft and smooth and never overly stripped or dry I have combination sensitive  acne prone skin and was told from a young age to avoid all products containing oil That was very bad advice and I wish I would have know in my teen years the importance of nurturing and not over stripping my skin I love this cleansing oil\\nread more I dont usually wear a full face of makeup my every day makeup usually consists of mascara and soap brows However I still like to do a double cleanse as I feel like it helps to break up surface debris and prep my

this one is definitely my favorite in terms of value and quality\\nread more I just got this during the VIB Rouge sale and so far I am loving it I wear very heavy eye make up Lots of liner mascara and eye shadow from everyday to bright vivid colors so a great cleanser is important I have been on the hunt to find something that will get it all off without a lot of scrubbing rubbing and tugging on the gentle skin around the eye area Apply it to a dry face and gently rub it around and over the eyes and watch everything break up and slide off then go in and scrub and wash your face as normal and rinse clean It doesnt feel stripping or drying I also didnt notice any residue Its a happy purchase for me\\nread more This stuff is amazing I have horrible enlarged pores I get monthly facials but not much you can do for pores Ive been hearing the hype on double cleansing but thought it was pointless I finally decided to buy this Seaberry oil cleanser and use it with the soy face cleanser most of my skin routine contains Fresh cosmetics Omg my first night using it and my pores look so great I was so astonished definitely will be a repeat customer Also since its my first night using this cleanser Ill see how my skin goes or course But so far Im in love\\nread more I was recommended this face wash after a makeupskin consultation at Sephora Honestly I hated it at first This idea of this oilbased cleaner running my makeup around my face making me look like a melted clown really turned me off But I stuck with it and began to use it nightly after I ran out of my trusty makeup wipes This cleanser really gets you clean and removed all of my makeup I feel so clean I dont feel the need to double cleanse as I do with a makeup wipe I typically use a makeup easerstyle cloth to wash off the makeup I have not yet broken out with this product and my skin doesnt feel dry or pull after I get done Once you get over the initial oil and melted makeup look it will really simplify your nightly routine I have used nearly the entire bottle If used regularly I think a bottle can last between 46 months making it worth your \\nread more This is by far the best 1st step to my double cleanse Im 43

the best consistency out of all of them Face doesnt feel dry afterwards and skin is pretty clean It also didnt break out my skin I was reserved to try an oil cleanser because oil  more oil on my skin

and most removers make my eyes sting and the next day I wake up with major bloodshot eyes This product does not do this I have tried so many different eye makeup removers and none have come close to Cliniques  Bruno using this product for years By far the best eye makeup remover No oily residue Removes makeup easily This is my all time favorite eye makeup remover Ive experimented with different brands but this one wins hands down It effortlessly takes off everything including waterproof mascara Not irritating to the eyes at all Ive been using this product for over 25 years For awhiike I was unable order or purchase the product online or at Clinique store locations They discontinued selling the product in Canada untiil I cane acroos it at Sephora on line I was so happy to find this make up remover as everything else I tried was sub par Please Clinique keep this product going Ive probably used it longer than 30 years It takes off make up with irritating my eyes or drying out my skin

I have tried all kinds and this is by far best Its my go to for removing all waterproof makeup Love it I have used this product for 20 years and love it It works great at the end of the day and leaves no film if you want to remove eye makeup and reapply An all time favorite Ive been using this eye make up remover for many years It is the best product for sensitive and dry skin I would never change it again Have tried them all I always go back to this one Gentle on my eyes and lashes when removing i have tried so many different eye make up removers from  to  but i always come back to this one because it helps me take off my waterproof mascara without damaging my lashes i like that it is cream based because i can manage the amount of product i used a lot better and it does not dry out the skin around my eyes as some liquid removers have done in the past Ive tried so many eye makeup removers and was looking for one that didnt irritate my sensitive eyes and didnt rip all my eyelashes out to get off the mascara Micellar waters just werent cutting it anymore To sum it up it works It removed my mascara without irritation What I do to use this is I take a dab on my fingers and message it into my lashes and over my lid to remove any shadow and mascara then I take a damp tissue and wipe away the melted mascara and excess lotion I would never leave it without wiping away the lotion but thats my preference I cant stand oily eyelids and once I wipe it away my eyes are not oily and the mascara is pretty much all gone Im very pleased with this and it will probably last forever because I use the tiniest bit every time and theres a lot in the bottle\\nread more Ive used this for years and it never lets me down I actually keep this in my shower and use it to take my eye makeup off during my nightly shower Its creamy doesnt burn rinses completely clean and gets the job done Ive even used it with contacts in my eyes I make sure to keep this one stocked It takes a tiny amount and one tube should last at least 4 months I was looking for something that would work for my acneprone and blackheadridden face at a reasonable price and I found this soap I have to say I like it a lot I use it twice daily on my face and chest and it works to draw out impurities and even the skin tone It takes a while but its gentle and I would recommend it to anyone I just bought my second bar first one lasted 3months not bad Love this charcoal detox soap bar I use it on my face when I exfoliate and I bought a separate one for my body Skin is so clean and smooth I recommend this product This is currently my favorite cleanser Its not too drying for oily skin and removes my makeup well I dont particularly find that it reduces pore size but it does help control oil a bit It is incredibly affordable given that a whole bar lasted me approximately 9 months It has a light but pleasant scent from the tea tree and bergamot oils as well This is the 2nd bar Ive purchased and I will continue to do so\\nread more Love this lasts a long time makes my skin feel so fresh and clear of acne I LOVE this soap Its the best cleanser Ive ever used on my face I have combinationoily skin with hormonal

but ended up being in love with this cleansing oil It swipes all my dead skin and left me a perfectsmoothwhite skin ever Everyone must have this I had this product for a year unsure if I liked it or not I finally started using it more when I realize it was actually rolling off dead skin from my face my face to be very smooth soft and moisturized afterward I usually used it when I showered and then use my glycol by the sink Im going to repurchase this because I tried other oil face wash and none of them took off the dead skin even the glycol This is my first review of a product ever Thats how good and important this product is to me hah I have oily acne prone skin and everything nonprescription either breaks me out or only marginally works This stuff WORKS It takes all my makeup off and its so easy to use I was using micellar water and cotton pads before and this is so much less waste Sure its a plastic bottle but its also lasted me twice as long as one full size bottle of

cleanser Ive ever used Ive user them all Banilla clean it zero all types Heimish balm clinique melt Erborian origins you get the picture theyve all been pretty good but after double cleansing Id still pick up leftover makeup with my toner pad I use this and Im so amazed it cleans like 98 of makeup my toner pad is almost completely white I still use toner as my 3rd and final cleansing step but with

is my first oilcleanser purchase and Im happy with the product I have very oily skin and some wonderful adult acne mostly whiteheads some deeper pimples time to time It feels wrong to add MORE oil to my face but I genuinely feel that I produce less oil over time with this product Sometimes I will wash my face with a cream cleanser at night but I always use this in the morning I feel it prevents

Within the first week I noticed a difference with my active acne It had calmed down and wasnt scarring as easily As far as Im concerned at this point FAB can do no wrong This stuff is wonderful but

that it doesnt dry out my skin or work too aggressively And it lasts a long time A little goes a long way Very similar to the Drunk elephant serum and a little cheaper I think it really helped the

much with my hormonal acne Just bought my 4th bottle\\nread more This absolutely changed my skin I noticed a difference in just one use I was skeptical after having used The Ordinary chemical exfoliant  which is FAR harsher This one says its gentle enough for daily use but I suggest spacing out uses until your skin is accustomed to it In comparison to The Ordinary one this stingsburns far less hardly at all and is much more effective Plus it doesnt have to be removed like a mask and is undetectable in the morning\\nread more I love this product and how well it works on my skin I have rosacea and my skin is quite sensitive but at the same time I love chemical exfoliators and collagen boosting ingredients and this product definitely is that I use it one day on and one day off and its effectiveness is not dimmed by any means It provides skin smoothing and pore cleaning and though it does tingle a bit there are no cons to this product In fact that tingle just tells me its working So if you do have sensitive skin just know this product is well formulated gentle on the skin and using it every other night is just as effective as using it every night Just be sure to use sun protection while using this product as it will make you more photosensitive\\nread more I received a mini sample of this and loved it so I went back and got the full size Absolutely worth it and

I also use trader Joes tea tree fw so I cant completely credit this for clearing my acne but I can say with certainty it HAS HELPED the one and only problem I have is that I went thru this whole bottle in 5 weeks washing 2x a day thats freaking crazy Ive had travel size stuff last me almost that long I considered trying a different product that I could get more longevity out of but when it

washed it thoroughly with liquid hand soap I hang the towel out and it is dry in the morning I can stretch the usage out of them with the above mentioned method and avoid having to place the cloth into the machine but still make sure it is clean Thick washcloths are too heavy and can scratch the skin This is nice and thin but doesnt have the strange feel of old school white handkerchiefs men still carry around today\\nread more Love these cloths I read about how these cloths are a total game changer on Into the Gloss and the blog was correct It is pretty good hydrating toner Love the

however this toner does an amazing job and hydrates it as well as balance it I would recommend Works well on my skin Leaves my face super clean Takes off most of my makeup Ive been using this cleanser for years its one of the only cleansers Ive used that actually makes my face feel clean and not like there is some kind of residue on it More importantly it removes all of my makeup even waterproof

after using this to keep your face hydrated Love this cleanser I have tried the mini skincare set of Belief that brought a bunch of different samples of products and this is the only one I truly liked

have honestly drastically changed for the better One of my favorite products I stopped using this cleanser Year ago and started using random cleansers I realized my face wasnt feeling as clean So I went back and bought this cleanser Immediately felt that clean fresh and soft skin again Its doesnt dry out my areas around lips retains the moisture love it This is my favorite face cleanser You only need to use a very very very tiny amount and it foams up and becomes a great lather for your face It removes all of my make up so well One bottle can last you a very long time because you only need a

to skin care routine Great product Doesnt make your skin dry leaves the feeling of freshness and softness will absolutely buy again I started using this toner once at night about 2 weeks ago and the results were so phenomenal I ditched my morning toner and switched to this one twice daily My face looks amazing Ive been struggling with breakouts and hormonal acne and this is helping tremendously This has now become my holy grail of toner First of all an essence thats less than 50 Sold The white tea leaves a beautiful soft scent and gives antioxidants for anybody who is looking for a preventative product Origins has been an OG clean brand for so long and its often overlooked So glad I found this gem LOVE this toner Its my favorite for the morning because it smells so wonderful and leaves my skin feeling fresh and bright Its not too harsh so I dont feel dried out but really helps set the stage for all of my other skin products I went into Sephora looking for a toner and an employee suggested this product I was hesitant because Ive never used the brand and honestly just bought because the bottle says it stays good for 24 months I use this twice a day ahead of my regular skincare routine and makeup application I like that its light and doesnt make me greasy before applying makeup It feels refreshing and soaks in almost instantly I dont love the style of the container I wish it was a mist or was easier to apply you need a cotton ball or something similar to apply but other than that I have no complaints\\nread more After recently moving to a desert environment my skin drastically changed I could feel and literally see my skin drying up and peeling I purchased this because the description intrigued me as it claims to not only hydrate but protect your skin Im not a skin expert but I definitely agree with the claims My skin was instantly hydrated I cant stand when my face feels dry or even remotely taut In addition it wasnt a temporary feeling rather I felt the hydration last all day Some days its windy and dirt sometimes hits my face gross I know especially since I enjoy walking outdoors a lot and my face isnt as nasty when I wash it off in the evening Not sure how true that is but Im so in love with this toner that I believe it lol Anyways I usually apply this with a cotton pad but it seems Im almost halfway done in about 2 months unfortunately though I could be applying more than the average person I love the fact its a clean product yet effective I also want to attribute my recent confidence boost in less makeup days to this product as well as the new Sephora vitamin C serum and moisturizer because my skin has been looking so clear and even in skin tone Im in love\\nread more This product is great in helping to even out skin tone I did not get this to help with break outs and it isnt advertised as something that will help with that but I swear if I have a pimple it is significantly smaller or gone the next morning If I dont use this for a few nights I can tell a noticeable difference the first time I use this again I wasnt expecting it to be anything great when I bought it just a good daily toner but I really feel it has done lots of things for my skin Beautiful product Ive tried all types of toners and this is it I love love love it I just wish there was a travel size one to take with me when i travel This is a great product Really made a difference in the appearance of my skin Ive tried so many toners throughout the years that have caused my sensitive skin to breakout burn dry out etc This is the first time ever that a toner not only felt amazing but made my skin look more eventoned and brighter after using This is the first product I tried from Origins and now I cant get enough of this brand I honestly dont think I can use another toner after this one because Im in love Definitely worth trying if your skin is sensitive\\nread more Ive been using this toner for many years  its the best Smells good not too drying natural ingredients and not too expensive I highly recommend it This is a great product that doesnt leave any residue on my eyes Usually other makeup removers leave a sticky oil on my eyes and I cant even see clearly for some time but this one doesnt have anything unnecessary It does a good job Worth buying again This is a great eye make up remover extensive always an absolutely hate when I make up removers leave the greasy oily residue on your eyes and make your eyes blurry this does none of that it removes the toughest Waterproof mascara Just pour some on a cotton pad with the cotton pad on your closed I for five seconds and then gently wipe and your waterproof mascara and waterproof eyeliner will mediately come off this product is similar to the Dior I make up remover but it is just more reasonable cost\\nread more Got this when I tried on lash extensions Loved how unlike every other eye makeup remover out there this really was gentle and Ive tried everything under the sun I just wish they had more travelfriendly sizes and packaging I had always used the Lancôme Bifacil remover since I only use waterproof mascara I tried this and fell in love Compared to the Lancôme this feels really gentle on the eyes while still being very effective I have sensitive eyes too and this didnt irritate them at all and it doesnt leave an oily film This is my first choice for waterproof mascara remover I have also recently tried the Glossier one and quite liked that as well I will say thats my 2nd choice and Lancôme now my 3rd The bottle is great too  easy to squeeze out every bit and good for travel\\nread more God I love this even though its expensive and I run through it far too quickly Of all the biphase eye makeup removers this is the one that leaves the least amount of oily residue on the eyes Its gentle doesnt burn and smells pleasant Really love this make up remover It conditions ur lashes really well and its my favorite for getting off that stubborn waterproof eyeliner that other removers can miss also smells great rose oil n leaves skin very soft The best make up remover for heavy or waterproof make up lovers I wear a lot of waterproof eye makeup and this strips right through it with minimal effort It is a bit oily so you will want to thoroughly wash your face afterwords but overall an amazing product It works the same as 40 Chanel make up remover I am happy with this product Its not oily and does a good job in removing eye makeup I would purchase it again I know when it comes to eye makeup remover being recommended by ophthalmologist isnt really a big swing but I have such sensitive eyes and this is the only product that helps remove waterproof eyeliner without making my eyes sting At that price my makeup remover better be good And it is The makeup goes off instantly and theres no residue I dont have to rub my eye a bunch It smells amazing but the odour is a little strong this will take off any layers of makeup on your face multiple coats of mascara waterproof  everything it will remove gently Tough enough to remove all makeup  even waterproof mascara  yet gentle enough to keep redness and irritation away I have very sensitive skin and its been difficult to find that combination until a Sephora employee made the recommendation Im so glad that she did Best eye makeup remover Love the smell too it removes my eye makeup in a second I decided to try this instead of buying my usual remover by Lancôme I find this comparable to the bifacil at removing my eye makeup I like the lotion like smell Doesnt irritate my eyes and doesnt leave any oily residue or anything I have been using this eye makeup remover for years It is gentle and removes all my mascara eyeliner shadow etc without irritating my eyes or causing eyelash fallout This product also removes waterproof makeup easily Hopefully it is never discontinued I adore this eye makeup remover It works well for my sensitive eyes and removes eye makeup easily and quickly I like to put a little bit of a cotton pad and place that to soak on my eye for about 5 seconds The eye makeup comes off SO EASILY afterwards and most importantly does not sting my eyes It is one of my holy grail products This toner is really hydrating and soothing very refreshing on the skin and a great prep step before serums My skin has been breaking out terribly ever since spring started this year It was extremely oily but felt very dehydrated at the same time After doing some research I decided to look for a toner with no alcohol in it I also wanted to find a toner that didnt contain any oils oils ALWAYS end up inevitably breaking out my sensitiveoily skin Searching for these two things led me to this toner and let me tell you I could not be happier that it did The second I put this toner on it felt like my skin took a nice long cool drink of water it so desperately needed My skin immediately felt smoother and plump After a few days of using this toner my skin started clearing up and what acne is left is significantly reduced and less red This is the first time Ive ever tried an Algenist product and I have to say I am very impressed and will be repurchasing and also exploring their full line\\nread more Love this toner Makes my skin feel hydrated and clean Its been a struggle for me to find something suitable for my sensitive skin and this is perfect Wow I was a loyal buyer of Mario badescu toner until this This is my holy grail I have cystic acne and fine lines on my forehead and this definitely smoothed out my skin Im obsessed Wish it came in a spray bottle but overall great toner Smells great and leaves skin feeling supple  clean and refreshed I was looking for a toner that is alcoholfree and am so happy to have found this one by Algenist It is hydrating and refreshing and doesnt dry out my skin I use several Algenist products and am happy to now add this one to my daily routine I like it its vary good hydrating toner Ok so I never want to be without this amazing hydrating essence I started using this daily and within a couple of weeks started to see some changes My skin appeared to be more even toned brighter hydrated and just overall fresh and looking Many of my troublesome dry patches are gone and my moisturizer and makeup apply better This is my first Algenist product and Im impressed Use this twice daily does not have a strong fragrance and doesnt leave your skin dry Love it cleans my skin both immediately and over time I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS BUT THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING This stuff works wonders fast I though ok now toner is essence and its just another expensive item that I dont need to add to my skin regime I never noticed any difference in my skin using a toner in the past but this product proved me wrong within 2 days of using this and adding the Face Hero skin oil before moisturizing all of my pores are 90 cleared out and shrunken My skin texture has improved more in 2 days than months of other products On week 2 and Im still amazed\\nread more This stuff is amazing Every exfoliant Ive ever used has made me break out so the gentle formula in this works perfectly for my sensitive skin Im left soft and glowing  it smells suuuper earthy not great but I dont get the cigarette smell others have been saying This product gets your skin so smooth its the best exfoliants The product cleans your face so well or wherever you use it that all the dead skin cells come right off and it makes your face feel like a babys bottom I immediately use my Fresh rose deep hydration facial toner after this product and then I go in with my La Mer Moisturizing Creme to finish it off to rejuvenate my skin before I sleep This is truly the best exfoliant\\nread more Smooth and light Makes my feel fresh and super clean  What I most like about it is that a little goes a long way and I dont need to rinse twice to clean everything Will purchase again Very nice product for sensitive skin Does not irritate I saw reviews about the smell but the smell is mild and natural and goes away with rinsing The scrub is not abrasive It feels like just enough It seems gentle but it is effective BTW I also saw reviews saying the scrub was not enough so If you are looking to sandpaper your face this is not the scrub for you I suffer from very sensitive skin and dry skin This didnt cause an itchy rash It helped remove my dry skin I would recommend this for others with sensitive skin I have super irritated skin I dont get many breakouts but I do have lots of redness This product exfoliates my skin perfectly and leaves my face softer and brighter than before without irritating it I like to use this at night and follow with a light moisturizer Im in love with all products from FAB I have extremely sensitive skin and oily skin and i use FAB complete line and the changes are amazing This is mu fave scrub so soft to the touch and non abrasive I have super sensitive skin and this exfoliator is magic Its gentle and it leaves my skin feeling super soft I use this on a daily basis abd so far it has not made me brake out The smell is not the best since it smells like chemicals but it does the job I recomendable this on people with sensitive and dry skin Not someone who has oily skin I got these as a gift since I love pineapples These wipes are amazing I love how easily makeup comes off with the soft side and how the rough side gently exfoliates my skin My face is so soft after using these Definitely my go to Also the smell is soooo refreshing No wipe compares to this The exfoliating side does its job the soft side is great for eyes and sensitive skin and the smell is pineapple heaven Love love love Favorite wipes ever My face is so clean fresh and soft If you have sensitive skin I would probably avoid these cloths as the exfoliating side is pretty abrasive I personally like these though I use the exfoliating side gently then I use the smooth side after I mostly use these after a run or the gym as I tend to sweat a lot The Watermelon wipes are great as well Havent found an exfoliating wipe as high quality as this there is a smooth side for initial wiping and the exfoliating side is very effective sharp little textured beads like hard to explain but very effective It lasts enough to also use on the back of your upper arms etc in the shower Also great for exfoliating lips Great price point I will continue purchasing these These wipes have really helped with texture and dullness They definitely give skin the glow and smell great Ive tried the other scents but THIS one actually smells like pineapple Very refreshing They dont dry out easily like many other wipes I love the dual side for exfoliating when I need it I have sensitive skin  these cause me no extra redness Buying them again The other scents need work These makeup wipes are so good First of all the smell is so good but if you dont like pineapples you wont like it because it smells exactly like them I saw previous reviews for this product and it said it helped them with kp kerotosis Pilaris which I have so I tried it and it has helped remove the bumps The makeup wipe is dual sided so it has the typical makeup wipe side to remove makeup and a exfoliating side which is kind of rough but I feel like it exfoliates\\nread more Just received a pack as a present as part of a Secret Santa Gift Exchange and used them for the first time and they may be my favorite so far of the line I usually get the Charcoal or the Watermelon but these smell so amazing and left my skin feeling so fresh and smooth Cant wait to try the Papaya ones next Bless the person who mentioned in the review that they use these pineapple wipes for their KP Keratosis Pilaris aka chicken skin I purchased two packages after reading that only halfway through the first package and I already see and feel a HUGE difference in my arms The bumps are much less red and so smooth Im literally shocked as no scrub has ever come close to the results Im seeing now\\nread more These are the best make up remover wipes I have ever purchased They smell so good and removes make up easily Will keep purchasing these I love these wipes They have a great scent and they really exfoliate Dont press too hard on your face bec they are pretty rough They would even be great at exfoliating knees or heels once you use them on your face I have found that these Pineapple Exfoliating Wipes are really great at helping to clear up KP keratosis pilaris and ingrown hairs After feeling that the texture was too rough for my face I tried them on the spots where I have KP and after three days of use my skin was surprisingly smoother I think its the pineapple extract that makes it work on KP for reference I also tried the exfoliating Green Tea wipes and they did not help the KP situation These are great I love finding alternative uses for my beauty products\\nread more Firstly the smell of these wipes is incredible So refreshing and pineappley Wouldnt recommend if you dont like strong smells The smooth side works well to remove makeup and the rough side is a great exfoliater Great for summer and for traveling This toner is lovely Removes all traces of cleanser  makeup leftover on the face post wash and does not burn or dry out my skin Even when my eczema flares up this is a product I can still use over the affected spots without issue Love this toner Leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean not too strong of a scent I use it with my reusable facial rounds and it still works perfectly Love this product I received a free trial size of this when I bought the cucumber cleanser  holy grail for me too  When I applied it I wasnt really thrilled about it and thought it wasnt gonna do anything for me but after applying my moisturizer I almost immediately felt such a big difference  my skin is now so much more moisturized and feels so soft although this never happens to me since I have such dry and sensitive skin If you were searching for a new toner dont hesitate even with my incredibly sensitive and reactive skin it works wonders  highly recommend for the wintertime coming up\\nread more Nice mild toner for those with sensitive skin  and those without Ive purchased this twice I have dry sensitive skin thats prone to allergic reactions and this doesnt burn or cause any irritation Will be purchasing again Ive been looking for a good toner that doesnt feel heavy or too astringent and this one is great I used Kiehls regular toner for a few years and just changed to this one I have Rosacea and thought maybe the most gentle toner would be better I like it a lot and plan to continue to buy the cucumber version This is a great toner for combination skin I noticed my skin looked way better while using this product The Kiehls line is by far my favorite I have dry skin and I started to use this toner on my daily routine and it worked really good definitely close my pores I love this stuff It has definitely been a part of my holy grail for a year or so now There is no alcohol in this so it doesnt dry out my skin I look forward to using this in the morning because it feels refreshing to me and seems to wake me up a bit A friend recommended this and I swear this scrub makes my skin sparkle I use once a week and try to time it with a night out or big meeting because my skin looks amazing that day Love it so far Buffs and removes Doesnt dry out my already dehydrated skin like many other brighteningexfoliating products Other people said it was rough on the skin but that hasnt been my experience Its a little sticky so Ive been using it in the shower which has been working nicely I absolutely love this It is so gritty without being aggravating to my skin It leaves my skin feeling so soft and does not leave it dry Also a small amount goes a long way My skin is more sensitive from the cold during the winter I bought this brightening polish based on a recommendation from a friend I use it once a week before applying a hydrating mask I find that it exfoliates effectively but is gentle enough that it does not irritate my skin I love this polish It clears my skin  makes my skin feel great after each use Im addicted My skin is very very soft after using this scrub Ive only used it on my fave and I enjoy it a lot An employee wisely recommended this product for me to try and after just one use I LOVE IT I had a lot of dead skin on my face and this took it ALL OFF In just one use Its also not too abrasive which is good since I have sensitive skin She recommended to not use this more than once every 3 days I will be purchasing this ASAP Love this stuff  best physical exfoliator Ive ever used The turmeric in it really makes your face GLOW Wish I could find a turmeric serum or moisturizer so that I could get that glow daily I have purchased this two or three times and like it very much It is not too gritty or too greasy and if you massage gently it leaves the skin with a lovely light glow and ready for moisturizer Best 2 minute mask I have ever used I have dry flaky skin and this helped scrub away my dead skin leaving my face soft as butter Not rough on the skin and I get a refreshed moisturized feel after applying Will purchase again I had a good result with one use of this My skin feels smooth and clean but not moisturized and clearly in one go you cant expect fading spots I like consistence and gel time and granules are just the right size A must Ive gotten my friends hooked and we all have different skin types I recommend this scrub before an event or for a refresh You cant go wrong with turmeric which is an antiinflammatory and literally makes me glow Get the MOST glow by using your vitamin C serum after using this product I can tell a huge difference when I stop using it and compliments when I use it regularly Definitely pricey for the body but face and décolletage definitely This is not a moisturizing scrub but an amazing starter for the rest of your routine  Do it\\nread more I love how soft my skin was after using it Not drying either Best makeup remover I have ever tried I wish it came in a bigger bottle I always come back to this eye makeup remover So

stripping and cleans well and thorough though I dont wear that much eye makeup mostly mascara and eyeliner no eye shadow Doesnt require tugging and easily removes I use the Bobbi Brown Soothing Face Cleanser Oil first then use this which makes it super easy to remove all traces of eye makeupThough more expensive than most but so worth it I dont wear eye makeup daily so I go through a bottle every 13 months HIGHLY recommend Tried Lancome once and just doesnt beat this one\\nread more My holy grail eye makeup remover Does a great job of removing waterproof and long wearing makeup Its a bit oily

works All of my eye makeup is water resistant and this takes it off without having to rub at my eyes IMO its much better than Lancomes Received as a sample and Ive been in love ever since Had to order because it was never available in stores This is amazing It helps you to remove all your makeup I loveeee this makeup remover I honestly wish they sold a huge bottle cause I would purchase It is a little pricey but it removes EVERYTHING and it doesnt irritate my eyes this is one of very few products that i buy again and again it removes eye makeup easily and gently with no oily residue and no film on your eyes after use I love this make up remover it removes everything and its smooth on the skin This is by far the best makeup remover Ive ever used I will never buy another brand I can only use waterproof mascara because others wont hold a curl That being said i hate products that make me tug and pull to remove the waterproof mascara This product removed instantly without having to tug and pull It also does not irritate my eyes which tend to be easily irritated by anything I put near them Absolutely love this\\nread more Very gentle and soothing even while removing heavy eye makeup and leaves the skin clean I would definitely buy this again Silky gentle and moisturizing as an oilbased cleanser but really stands out as a makeup remover I tried to get Milk Makeup Eye Pigment off several times with Sephoras instore remover  with moisturizer and still had some left behind This stuff took it right off without me needing to scrub my eyelids Really like it Removes my waterproof mascara and liner like a dream and conditions my lashes I have definitely noticed my lashes have become thicker softer and healthier since using this product yes its pricey thats why I use it on a qtip instead of a cotton round to conserve product but its amazing I even use a swipe on each lash line at night if I didnt go out and didnt wear makeup that day because it feels that good on my lashes\\nread more I got this as a sample size and literally ran out to get the full size the second it was gone I use a longwearing drugstore mascara that is virtually impossible to remove It barely

different kinds of eye makeup  plus leaves your skin feeling extra soft and supple instead of rubbing and irritating delicate skin Must have\\nread more I only use this makeup remover on my eyes and I love it It gets off all of my eye makeup and makes my eyes cleaner then any makeup remover ever has It doesnt burn my eyes or dry them out which is a plus because of my sensitive skin Truly takes off the most difficult makeup I have been using the Clarifying Lotion 1 for about 2 weeks and I definitely see that it is loosening the dead skin on my face However it doesnt remove it I have to exfoliate I have very dry skin and live in a very dry climate It doesnt sting and doesnt dry my skin YAY I really love this product I have dry skin but when I apply it on my face I dont feel my skin over dry It take off all the impurities that the cleanser didnt do I feel my skin smooth and cleaned I have used a few bottles of this and find it awesome for my drycombo skin I usually use it in the morning with a cotton pad INSTEAD OF cleanser to avoid over cleansing my face It removes overnight buildups without drying my skin still need to properly moisturize afterwards and the cooling sensation wakes me up A Must Have Fights acne and excess oil but not overdrying Many toners dry me out too much but not this one Even if youre combination skin I would recommend this one not the level 2 toner If youre very oily consistently then maybe the level 2 is better for you but this one does the job quite well Seems to work well for me without being drying The three step process has really helped my skin I use this every night after cleansing before moisturizer Its amazing to see what this toner takes off that the cleansers leave on your skin I use this back and forth with the Clinique number 2 clarifying lotion as that ones a bit harsher This one however I can use every day and its not too strong on my skin Amazing product This is one of the better cleanserstoners Ive used definitely gentle but gets the job done Ive been using this with the Redness Solutions Cleanser and Moisturizer and it has helped calm my redness so much It has also done a lot for my texture as well my skin looks a lot smoother than before I have combination skin Mostly dry and sensitive As a person that ALWAYS routinely moisturizes morning and night I give this 5 stars I cant start the day without moisturizing my skin if I dont it feels tight and leathery I put this on in replace to my moisturizer for the day as I was running late for work and it worked perfect had no problems I break out very easy if I use new products so I was hesitant to buy this but when I got matched for my foundation a few weeks back the gal put this on my face I really liked it a lot it was light weight and I noticed my face didnt spaz out After this one I might try to others to see which one I like better I did noticed my face was smoother and more glow like and my dark spotsredness seemed lighter  I think the only con to this is that they should come up with an applier for this I just get little pads or fluff balls and those do the trick too This picture is me this morning after I put it onwithout makeup just mascara feels nice and fresh I struggle with dark spots and my former acne aftermath and this stuff works great \\nread more amazing so I washed my skin with the Clinique facial wash and than exfoliated with tarte exfoliate stick when I got out of the shower my face looked dry I knew my makeup would have issues it always does but today I used this lotion and WOW what I thought was just dry skin was just flakes of skin that were wiped away and now my makeup does cake EVERYONE NEEDS THIS This clarifying has work so far my skin look cleaner less red and it doesnt dry my skin I have noticed that my rosacea somehow it hasnt flared up which makes me happy because I was very skeptical about trying a toner but I can tell the difference on my skin Use this every day after cleansing Does not dry out skin even in the winter This toner has worked wonders for my skin I no longer have to reapply moisturizer throughout the day I enjoy applying this product it wakes me up in the morning Great product moisturizers without feeling greasy My favorite toner prefect for dry skin I see some saying they have combo might want a different number If your combo with dry it should be number 2 if your combo with oily it should be 3 love this product use it everyday  This is the most gentle of the clarifying lotions and I use it once per day I notice when I regularly use it I dont get blackheads on my nose or chin They suggest using it 2x per day but I have highly sensitive fair skin and that seems to be a bit much so I only use it once a day at night Always the best Ive been using it for years A must have in any ladys facial lineup Forever young I love this product So simple to use Has really helped with how oily my t zone can get I cant compare this much to other toners quality wise because I havent tried that many But convenience wise I love this toner I feel like Im wasting product with liquid toners and cotton pads but stick toner just goes straight on my face so I cant waste it I stopped using toners for a while then picked this one up and Im glad to have toner back in my routine My skin condition has improved My skin stays moisturized longer I am pleasantly surprised with the amount of moisture already in the stick toner I usually apply it on clean but slightly wet skin But I have applied it after my skin dried off completely after cleansing and it still goes on so smooth\\nread more Very hydrating Ive been using this product for at least a year and I love it so much I 100 recommend I love this toner I got this as my first toner and I can confidently say that it

after my face had an allergic reaction to a rose water toner that I had been using for two years I guess thats how long my body needs for an allergic reaction because my rose soap did the same next This toner has been the only thing thats worked nicely with all of my products to keep my cystic acne away and not contain my two big allergy ingredients rose and aloe It doesnt sting and I follow it up with COSRx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid If I dont use them together it doesnt work at all One without the other Cystic acne immediately Really I just got rid of one on my nose because I didnt pay

you have really really oil skin get a sample of this and try it out I love origins products including this one Its a refreshing ritual for me at the end of the day I did switch to the MegaMushroom which is more expensive and maybe a little better but this product does the job This toner has an incredible earthy scent which is not too overpowering I found that it did a great job without stripping It reduced the oil on my skin without stripping it I love this toner Ive tried other ones and they were not good Just a few drops and you are good to go You feel very refreshed and renewed

love powder cleansers in general but this one is the best Ive tried I love that its individually packaged I love that its gentle and hasnt irritated my skin but I legitimately noticed my discoloration improving after about a week even after years of other Vitamin C and AHABHA products I was really skeptical especially because it doesnt stay on your skin for that long but MAN it really does work It might be a little drying for drier skin  winter time though and you shouldnt use it on active blemishes it stings yeah I know Im a dummy I have a habit of constantly trying different cleansers but I think I will stay with this one for a long time To me its totally worth the price\\nread more this is the most amazing VIT C product and it does not get enough attention in the beauty world Ive tried

bright and gets rid of lines works really fast too My mom told me about it Just like with everything else my mom tells me I was very skeptical I mean what does she know right But I decided to give it a try I bought a 7 day trial pack that had 7 of these packets and a booster serum thing that you mix yourself and it only lasts 7 days because it is that fresh and goes bad after 7 days Anyways the powder cleansing packets won over me almost right away I noticed my skin feeling and looking slightly more radiant in a couple days By the end of 7 days I was sold and absolutely hooked As for the 7 day serum thing I am not so sure about it It didnt impress me enough to buy more of it I did end up using it for 9 days There was product left over and I was not about to throw it out Use by dates are guidelines right Anyways my face didnt turn into a pumpkin or anything but I also didnt come out of my 7 days with the serum looking like Gigi Hadid People tell me I have high expectations I am now back buying the second supply of these powder cleansers I use it only in the morning I wet my face and rub the content of one packet in It lathers really well I dont wash it off yet I leave it on while I brush my teeth Those dreadful two minutes man at least it makes me happy thinking that I am getting two things done during that boring time Then I wash it all off and ta da I am all fresh and rejuvenated You can also do what my mother does and use only half of the packet and save the other half for the next day She swears by it Who knows she could be right there as well\\nread more Wow

with it is that it testS on animals according to PETA Love love love this cleanser No residue and it doesnt irritate my eyes at all This is one of my holy grail products I started incorporating micellar water into my routine just one I bought from the drugstore but after reading up on some of the ingredients I wanted to switch to a cleaner product I tried Caudalie I love a lot of their products but it left my skin with a weird tacky residueI returned and tried this and its amazing No residue just give a minute to fully dry before doing the next step in your routine It does an excellent job cleansing I often use it on its own instead of double cleansing and I have oily skin And it fully cleans my skin not as great for removing a full face of makeup not because it doesnt do the job but you need several cotton pads to get everything off and its a little pricey for the amount you get so I only use for light makeup days\\nread more Perfect for sensitive skin Use it twice a day and makes skin look great I was very pleasantly surprised by this Ive tried other micellar waters in the past and they havent worked very well for me When I got a sample of this I wasnt expecting

sure I get all eye and makeup off Then I use it in the morning before applying makeuplotion to save time instead of washing my face TIP I do use the Shiseido facial cotton pads It doesnt take as much

drysensitivered skin I highly recommend\\nread more I use this as my second cleanser  and use it almost like a toner every night and it just refreshes my skin  I wish it was a little cheaper because I

follow a quality cleansing routine It plumps my skin and minimizes the look of pores I hate the price but love the results too much to stop buying This is absolutely a great product I was using something similar from a different brand and more expensive I ran out of it and I wanted to find something that would work the same way and more available I decided to try this and I love it I noticed my laugh line was showing when I ran out of my old product and didnt use anything for about a week I started to use this and I swear my laugh line was gone after a couple of days My skin has never looked so good People tell me that I have beautiful skin I have Murad to thank for that All the skincare products that I use are from Murad PS all you need is ONE PUMP per use After I wash my face

thicker so it stays where you put it on your skin no need to rub it all around it absorbs readily Worth the money and lasted me a long time The term holy grail is often overused  and this is the only time I have used it to describe a product I discovered this serum 6 years ago and found myself going back to it time after time Nothing else has measured up so I have been using it exclusively for 3

oily A keeper of a serum Goes on light not greasy I have been using this product for years and am more than satisfied with the quality of my skin It keeps wrinkles at bay and is great for my throat as well keeps skin looking fresh and glowing Used for 4 years cannot do without it After one bottle my very deep forehead lines are much less noticeable Ive struggled with them for a few years and this serum is HOLY GRAIL I use this as a primer on my face for a perfect blend as well I used Estée Lauder for years even in my 20s before I needed antiaging products and I had beautiful skin With continued use my skin was great for years and I had no wrinkles on my 40th birthday One day for some reason I got it in my head that I needed to be using more natural products silicone free and no fragrance blah blah blah I convinced myself that the Estée Lauder that had never let me down was now bad for me Im almost 44 and Ive had terrible skin for the last couple of years spending tons of money at Sephora on natural brands What a joke Nothing works like this and a few other tried and true things from Estée Lauder I feel so dumb for straying Estée Lauder for life If you are reading this

mid 30s my skin used to be super oily and now I have an oily tzone but dry super red patches Fun right I got Botox on my forehead around 33 because I started getting pretty noticeable lines First plus about this serum my skin looks so much smoother I budget for Botox this year and I dont even need it Extra vacation  Dont get me wrong this serum is stupid expensive That said 2nd huge bonus is that it makes your skin feel like silk after applying it Sooooo smooth Makeup goes on like a dream and it does not make me oily I love this stuff Besides the price I can say that it has one more negative

review on behalf of my mom who I purchased this item for Shes 55 and is beginning to get concerned about her facial contours wrinkles to her marks of happiness to me So she religiously used this all

me\\nread more Like liquid gold A little goes a long way I love it worth the price Amazing I have very very sensitive acne prone skin and have always struggled to find something to reduce my redness and spots without giving me a rash and this product does that I only use it 23 times a week but has made a huge difference in my skin and the results were pretty quick I would definitely recommend this product worth the price I love that this is real retinol and not a retinoid sub A lot of the the retinoids are gentler but less effective at a given percentage This has helped knock back hormonal acne and has faded some age spots and softenedREMOVED wrinkles No it doesnt smell pretty but I prefer that to irritating added coverup fragrances I do have to dry my hands before using the bottle but youre not supposed to apply retinol with wet hands so its not much of an issue for me Ive had no issues with the bottlepump breaking and it keeps the product fresh I have dry skin and I actually like the formulation Yes its thick and rich but I need the moisture and it doesnt pill under my SPF lotion or with any of my other oils and creams Im not a huge foundation wearer but no trouble with that either I use NARS long wear I will keep repurchasing this\\nread more Great beginner retinol  layers well underneath a moisturizer and oil for nighttime The lower concentration worked well for every other day to start and now Ive built up to daily The twist top is a bit strange but I will definitely purchase again Great retinol product from FAB Best retinol I have ever used I have tried many things to combat my face getting red and puffy at the end of the day and was recommended to use retinol to try and work it out and it just surprised me that after one use my skin was able to hold out the entire day and I didnt look like I had been running around all day Would definitely recommend for retinol first users and even though the price tag is a bit out there it is the best retinol I have found so far I plan on using it thrice a week and hope it will not dry me out as much but well see\\nread more I LOVE this retinol I didnt think it was doing much at first so I used it 3 days in a row and wow did I definitely see it was doing something My skin got sensitive and dry but I stick with it after reading reviews saying the beginning is the hardest part Im SO glad I did My face has never felt this soft before nor have I had so many compliments on how my skin looks I currently use it 3 times a week and will gradually increase The one week of dry sensitive skin was so worth the results\\nread more Great product FAB does retinol right with the design of using a pump and concealed lid Great beginner retinol product Perfect for beginners I had a lot of acne scars and dark spots but this retinol has changed my life I just absolutely love this product my skin is sensitive and prone to adult acne and this helped keep my skin clear and improve my lines and hydration Excellent gentle retinol Ive just increased to nightly usage and have been noticing happier healthier skin without any of the downsides of retinol products Ill definitely purchase again I have extra sensitive skin and am prone to eczema and milia I had to start using this once every 3 days but now am using it daily each night I love this product because it smooths out my skin even through the occasional eczema flare ups and my acne breakouts have become very minimal I do find that I need to use a thicker night time moisturizer when using this product and need to put on sunscreen the following morning I learned the hard way when I first started but once you get the peeling and sunburn one day I never forget sunscreen now a blessing in disguise for forcing me into a better skincare routine This retinol serum is a great starter for people just getting into using retinols and especially for someone with extra sensitive skin like myself\\nread more I saw results from the first day I used it Fine lines diminished and skin felt more elastic I put some on my boyfriends face and the results werent so instant perhaps I saw a difference because I had already had a good skin care routine This is my third bottle My skin looks firmer and clearer when I use this serum It has a lovely scent that is refreshing to apply I like to use this after my moisturizer as it helps plump my skin Love this product I am a skincare nut and have tried everything The Genius serum actually gives me noticeable results I just wish it came in different sizes its really expensive Best vitamin C serum out there Ive used this on and off for 5 years but always come back to it I will layer it with my nightly retinol every other night and its amazing safe to dot around the contours of the eye also Love this with the Genius Collagen and collagen for lips Lighter and faster absorbing than the Ole C serum I used to use This is a permanent switch This has really helped with lightening my acne scars without breaking me out I already looked young for my age but this makes me look even younger More bushy tailed and bright eyed My skin improve after using it for a month My skin feel soft and niceThe product isnt sticky at all Its doesnt cause me to breakout and Im so glad I found this Its great I dont even need retinol because this product so much more than a regular vitamin I only paid 1999 for this product at my local Marshalls Very impressed Been using it for a solid month and will invest in the full price My only complaint is the smell but I must say I hate fragrance in my skincare I really like this serum It seems to help my skin I got this in a trial kit elsewhere but definitely recommend this product for texture Wow I started using the Genius line a month ago and im in shock Im 37 with mostly dry skin not so bad in the springsummer but has flaky dry patches in the fallwinter if im not careful I recently started noticing a few fine lines a dark area on one cheek and that my makeup didnt look as great as it used too My skin care routine prior to this was wash with a drugstore brand cleaner and my Clarisonic and moisturize with French brand 64 moisturizer twice a day Well

or felt better The dark spot is fading and so are the fine lines\\nread more It really is an outstanding serum I have had the pleasure of trying lots of different serums and Algenist wins every time Every level of antiaging seems to get better and better Really effective I was a skii skepticuntil I decided to take the plunge and just try an skii product This serum is amazing Im in my 30s and my approach to skin care is preventative This is very expensive but worth it I dont wear makeup I follow a 7 step Korean skincare routine This is essential in my routine I love SKII I love it so much every time I travel I am on the look out for SKII at duty free stores I recently pair this serum with an serum booster tool and noticed a significant difference in the density and elasticity of my skin Highly recommend this product Worth the investment I did get some samples of this for a few months before I broke down and bought it I dont use it every night just 34 times a week Helps with dark spots and skin seems firmer Will buy again Love this It helps balance my complexion and will continue to use it I use this with the RNA face cream Its Amazing I have extremely dry Accutane skin and this is one of the few products that works without making my face look like a skincare soup Seriously moisturizing and sinks right into skin I can easily layer other products like sunscreen on afterward too After only 1 use I noticed that my skin is smoother and brighter Love how product absorbs really fast in to skin If you can afford it buy it I got a sample and I like it The price of full size is not very cute but its really a good product Will consider to get one after done my current serum I thought that I should review this because I have gone through three bottles of it so I can give a good review I feel that it works the texture of my skin is so much smoother when I use this and I do feel like its smooths out lines There a few times like I have forgotten to use it for a while like I went on vacation and I didnt use it all out of laziness And I could tell a difference after and I could tell a difference after a couple days that I wasnt using it Sometimes I will just put this on at bedtime alone or later it but I always wake up with a really nice skin Im super happy with it I will continue to use it Also I have tried their serum in their higher luxury line that

was wondering if it would really work And after several weeks I can honestly say it does I swear my skin is firmer softer and I have less wrinkles I makes me feel Ether too because it has brighten my skin Its worth the price truly A lot also goes a long way Really worth it Great product I have been using the RNA Power Serum both morning and evening for a month now As far as the claims I can say that my skin looks plumper dewier brighter and more moisturized The Serum is very light absorbs quickly and has slight fresh fragrance The fragrance was a concern because I have sensitive skin and have had problems with other SKII products in the past but not this this one I think this a great product It delivers on its promises I can definitely see and feel the change in the moisture level of my skin It is pricy but this product goes a long way I have used it twice a day for a month and it still have 23 of my bottle left I dont know yet if I will repurchase after my bottle is done but that

it is the plant polysaccharides in this formula that make it such a winner The bamboo sap and whatever else that makes it feel all silky like that I have found few other products out there that incorporate good quality polysacchariderich ingredients and its a shame I can just feel how soft and slippery it is as soon as I put it in my hand and when it has absorbed all the way there is no sticky or oily residue  my skin just feels SOFT and hydrated It doesnt feel heavy and sticky I usually put it on under moisturizer or sometimes I use it as a ligh weight moisturizer on top of another serum that is a little heavier I had a big sample of this before I bought it I wish they made a smaller size of this so I could carry one in my purse Seems there is nowhere near enough alcohol in this product to dry out skin I think the alcohol is probably what makes it easy to spread it in such a thin layer but when it evaporates Im still left with this awesome layer of moisture on my skin sooo The alcohol doesnt bother me at all\\nread more This product was recommended instore by Sephora employee I am enjoying it immensely I dont like fragrances added to skin care products this product has a lovely delicate odor that completely matches its silky feel on the skin No residue of any kind I use it am and PM in my routine I think serums are high priced in general this is not as expensive as some Ive tried Love this product I am 32 and my face is so sensitive and acne prone I was not using any serums because all the ones I had tried previously made me break out I got a recommendation to try this serum and Im glad I did It has not broken me out and leaves my skin feeling silky and soft along with my normal moisturizer Thank you AMORE for making something for extremely delicate skin like mine Love love love Best Rejuvenating serum helps with break outs hydrates and brightens your skin and smells Amazing It also less forever My skin is very dry and this works fantastically to hydrate and plump it up I can go makeup free after I started using this I was constantly on the lookout for reliable moisturising serum as I have dry and sensitive skin I got this product in full size and this is now officially my new favourite the old fav was Decorte Moisture Liposome Serum It does exactly what it describes and the bonus is its extremely calming The great smell just makes me want to use it any chance Ive got Will definitely purchase again Expensiveyes Amazingabsolutely Ive tried a lot of Sephoras serums and only Amorepacific makes a difference on my skin I used to use the moisture bound as well but thought Id see if it was the serum that was making the difference so I tried a different moisturizer brand Its the serum that makes the difference Im hooked I hated all moisturizers  until now this entire line is pricey But worth it My esthetician recommended this line and I have not looked back since Get the whole line  Once I tried this serum its hard to use anything else I used this serum for over 2 years now This serum is super hydrating and a little goes a long way Although the price point is on the higher side it lasts you for months It uses bamboo leaf extract instead of water so it soaks into the skin and doesnt evaporate improved complexion and gives radiance The serums I was using before I switched to this serum were generally 300  I thought that La Prairie was the end all be all and I didnt expect much when trying this Wow was I pleasantly surprised I have combination skin which includes an oily chin and nose areas with dryer cheeks and normal forehead This serum works for my entire face Id grown accustomed to not applying products to my combinationacneprone areas so being able to use a product that actually works while not breaking me out is fantastic My dry areas are no longer dry and the rest of my skin is hydrated without being oily My first bottle has lasted me two months of thus far already justifying the very fair price Thinking back to when I used to spend anywhere from 300700 on serums makes me cringe My skin has never looked better since I started using this product and I hope they never stop making it It glides easily over my skin and spreads nicely Two pumps is enough to cover both my face and neck Like all AMOREPACIFIC products the scent is light and fresh I truly cant say enough positive things about this incredible serum\\nread more So far one of the best serums I have tried Smoothes the skin moisturize and feed the skin with the necessary hydration I absolutely love this product I got a sample randomly while in the store at one point and saw such an immediate difference in my skin I figured I would splurge and give it a try Im very happy with the results Its very hydrating has improved my breakouts and texture majorly The only downside is that this product is crazy expensive I have gone through the entire bottle and will be purchasing another I love the way this serum feels on the skin I noticed a big difference in the way my moisturizer is absorbed into the skin And for oilycombo skin moisturizing is a must Fragrance is a bit strong but so are other Amorepacific products Otherwise a must have I absolute love this texture on my skin Not only does it make my makeup better in the day time but my skin is even brighter I just love how amazing my skin feels and redness goes down on my skin I am on my second bottle of this and this keeps my skin beautifully hydrated when weather changes or when winter is coming I love the way it makes my skin bright takes down my redness and overall helps me produce more moisture I have been using Amore Pacific for two years now and will never look back  I got this in a Murad kit and i haev fallen for it As a almost 30 year old i wanted to take a fight against aging skin and my adult acne which is mainly hormonal I use this nightly sometimes during the day if i need it But i have noticed along with the other products in this line help keep my skin supple and smooth I suggest if you use this use it with a second prodict in this line or with the renewal line Im a 32 year old women who suffers from hormonalcystic acne I decided to give this a try and it has worked really well for me When I stared to use this I had very painful under the skin pimples and I was miserable It took about a week for me to start seeing results I gave makeup a break during that time so that I could give my skin a break This is a nice serum that doesnt over dry my skin It gentle on my skin but gets the job done \\nread more Is that you still get acne AND fine lines I wanted to wait until I used this for a bit before writing a review Ive been using this serum for about 2 months and it has changed my skin I luckily didnt have a purge period Its not harsh or irritating and it does what it says it does It fights acne and my signs of aging have gotten better too Will definitely repurchase and recommend Does what it says If you struggle with acne buuuyyyyyyy this Ive been using this in the morning after I wash my face and although I havent been using it long enough to see any real effects yet it feels really nice on my skin and does not leave me feeling greasy or overly dry Product performed as expected Knocked out some stubborn acne I was experiencing and I noticed visible improvement to wrinkles While pricey a little goes a long way First pic is with light coverage foundation which I never thought Id be able to wear a light coverage foundation second pic is no makeup I cant find my before pic of when my skin was bad but I was covered with redness covered with huge cystic pimples lots of texture This is such an improvement And that picture was taken three weeks after starting this product Murad makes another great product Since I turned 30 my skin has gone through some big changes I developed deep painful hormonal acne all along my chin and where the beard area would be on my face I was in a pretty bad depression over my skin I had the breakouts terrible redness tons of texture If I left my house without makeup someone would always ask me oh are you ok Your face has a rash Then I found Murad I started with this product Im on my 2nd bottle and I will never be without it I use it twice a day morning I use it after my essence and vitamin c serum I wait about 5mins before applying this and I use this on the nights I dont use my pure retinol The results are nothing short of magical I never thought my skin would look semi normal The texture is almost gone I only get breakouts around the time of my period and even then they dont become the painful mountains they used to I dont get as many and they dont turn into the aggravated pustules anymore Im only 33 so I cant say much about the wrinkle smoothing I dont have many wrinkles except under my eyes and Im not putting this under my eyes For reference I have combo skin very sensitive hormonal acne rosacea This product did not irritate me AT ALL NOT AT ALL OH HAPPY DAY I love this product and I love this brand They are expensive but I only get one face and Im willing to invest in my skincare at this stage in my life\\nread more Ive been using this product and its predecessor for 5 years and routinely get told I look 5 years younger than I am Additionally I worked outside in the desert and mountains for years so should arguably look like beef jerky This stuff good sunscreenMAGIC amazing product I have extremely oily skin but not really break outs But since most serums are thick and heavy I hate the feeling The stuff does instantly in the skin and I wear it under makeup My skin looks so clear and a huge reduction in forhead lines LOVE LOVE LOVE I love this from first use It helps my skin a lot No new breakouts Looks like this product stop the proces of breakouts in the beginning Very light absorbs very fast LOVE IT Love this seems to really be keeping the hormonal acne at bay This product is amazing It has helped with all of my face issues from small bumps under the skin to cystic hormonal breakouts I havent found many products to help with hormone related skin issues so that fact that this really works makes its holy grail status for me Its lightweight not too drying if you have dry skin use with a moisturizer and very effective It does what it claims and the retinol for anti aging is an added benefit It has a lot of ingredients but its suitable for my sensitive skin Its expensive but it lasts a decent amount of time because you dont need too much and I use it every day Its effective for a lot of skin issues when so many other acne products are not so I will definitely repurchase\\nread more Ever since getting my IUD my skin has been TERRIBLE with hormonal acnerednesssensitivityetc Ive tried so many different skin care routines and even expensive dermatologist creams Nothing worked and I end up with irritated redness and peeling on top of acne like I was back in my teens As a professional in her 30s this is beyond frustrating Tried this at MIL urgingbest decision ever My skin has improved substantially and is almost back to its preIUD level Acne has cleared almost completely If Im getting a little bump its shrunk if not completely cleared by morning Ive seen an overwhelming reduction of breakouts with constant use I also love that this fights wrinkles too Battling acne and fine lines and wrinkles at the same time has posed a problem with layering creams that counteract each other This stuff does a wonderful job at both My forehead looks much smoother This stuff is now an indispensable part of my daily routine\\nread more I was amazed by this product the result was almost instant I was suffering from terrible acne at the jay area which was almost impossible to get rid of for months i used dermatological products with no obvious improvement Its by far my favorite serum Love this product My skin cleared up in just 2 days and after a week of using it my skin looks so much clearer and brighter Within 2 days of using these my skin cleared up I went from using them every day to now every other day to control any blemishes Absolutely love them This is absolutely a must for acne prone skin I have very sensitive combinationdry skin This helps with my acne without drying my skin or irritating it I also like to use this because it helps me see if my cleansing didnt get all of my makeup This is an absolute staple in my skincare routine I also love that its got the clean at Sephora mark Highly recommend Ive been using this with the FAB Red Clay cleanser for about a month now and my skin has completely cleared up I didnt have lots of acne but around my period my skin would go nuts but has been clear since adding FAB These pads dont dry my skin out Im super prone to peeling when my skin dries out Ill keep using this as long as its made Definitely helped out my 16yr with her breakouts Uses it a few days a week I bought this a few weeks ago and its my first purchase from this brand I have normal skin and being in my late 30s I get that 12 pesky breakout every month used Kate Somervilles EradiKate works beautifully This was recommended by a Sephora employee and said it was something I can use daily as a toner as well So far so good My skin isnt dry and I havent had a breakout yet Very satisfied with these acne pads I will purchase again I LOVE these I use it like a toner in the morning Theyre not drying These pads have drastically changed my skin texture After one week using 2x day my skin is smoother cleaner brighter I have used every product under the sun prescription medical grade cheap expensive and nothing has done for skin what these have in such a short amount of time I am 35 with ongoing adult acne mainly papules and pustules with heavy congestion but all of that has disappeared with these pads You will have a purge but continue using these they are worth the 30\\nread more I use these to spot treat my Tzone where I get hormonal acne I love FAB because its affordable but does as good of a job as products twice the price When I use these consistently I barely have problems in my Tzone caused my dirtgreasebuildup Theyre also gentle enough for sensitive skin and smell amazing Holy crap I love this Ive been suffering from acne only on my left side of my face that was pretty deep in there I tried so many acne meds and topical creams but none of them ever worked I have dry skin so I was worried that these meds were drying me more out I decided to ask one of the girls at Sephora what she would recommend I told her my problems and recommended these pads Within a couple of days the big pimples I had deep on my cheek where drying out and getting smaller This combined with the ordinary niacinamide have been very helpful at keeping my face cleared Im already on my second tub and know just use it once a day or very other day Def recommend for anyone looking for something thats not harsh at all\\nread more These pads are amazing They consistently clear up any breakouts and dont dry out the skin Ive used them twice a day with no issues or irritation though nightly or every other night is more than enough depending on your skin Each pad is soaked pretty well so you get plenty of product with each use Highly recommend I was hesitant at first because of the salicylic acid and tea tree oil that is in this Tyically I dont react well to either but however they formulated this is great for my sensitive skin that is currently experiencing acne I wouldnt go overboard with this product but right now I am using once to twice a day at the most But once a day is probably what is best for my skin currently I love the results I am getting This is the first First Aid Beauty product I have tried I highly recommend\\nread more LOVE THESE These clearing pads actually work I was having bad travel acne from flying and picked these up Not only did my acne and redness go down it didnt dry my skin out or make it irritated I have very sensitive skin I would recommend these to anyone I havent used clearing pads in over 10 years so I was skeptical of picking these up I am 100 satisfied with how these have helped my skin These work really well This is great to have on hand for when a blemish pops up The 2 Salicylic Acid Tea Tree Oil  White Clay are very effective to combat a breakout There is no alcohol which is a big plus I do not rub these pads all over my face only on the affected area I dont want my skin to get used to the Salicylic Acid because it wont work as well when it is actually needed These last forever too These arent really a must have but they are definitely nice to have\\nread more This really works At first I thought I was breaking out from it since I developed a few blemishes after the first few days I used this but instead they disappeared within a couple more days of using the wipes The smell isnt the best but it feels so refreshing when you use it When I experience hormonal breakouts these pads help minimize my breakouts and restore my skins texture without overdrying my skin Got it for my son It cleaned up his acne fast Cut the pads in half and I strongly recommend only using every other day These pads are strong enough to have a noticeable effect but they have enough soothing ingredients that help with irritation and actually heal your skin Ive always struggled to find a salicylic product that would work but didnt burn my skin but these are wonderful They have helped with acne congested pores tone and my skin is definitely smoother\\nread more Amazing product Ive started using it in place of my nightly moisturizer and the results have been great Plumped younger looking skin I havent had in 10 years Leave on overnight

month to see results There was a time when I almost gave up on it and wanted to discontinue using it I learned my lesson I must always give the new product some time unless my skin reacts to the

greasy and a little goes a long way It has lightened my dark circles and reduced my fine lines This serum is fantastic It does great work at brightening a dull complexion as the products name suggests and does so without creating a reactivity on my skin It did tingle a little when initially applied but that faded away after a few days Ive used other pricey vitamin C serums in the past that didnt give me a healthy glow like this serum does and I am now a true fan of this product I received this product as a free sample to try but will purchase this soonits that good and worth every penny of

skeptic just go ahead and try it It is money well spent This is the most reliable product I have ever used You might break out at first as it pulls toxins out of your skin especially if you pair it with a chemical exfoliant It really makes a huge difference to the texture of your skin Even during the purging phase you skin will be noticeably softer I stopped using it at one point because the

skin is back to baby soft I will be using this consistently and without interruption going forward\\nread more Im incredibly skeptical of products that claim to be detoxifying and dont have

totally love the texture of the serum I love how it reduces the appearance of open pores on my skin and makes it appear smooth applying it twice a day is a must The most effective Pore Minimizing serum EVER  This product is great at filling pores without clogging them It really helps your foundation to look fantastic I dont apply it to my entire face just around my cheeks where I have visibly larger appearing pores My ultimate favorite serum and primer of all times I am so sad to hear it does not work for some people I have very ry ski and i also have very large ores on my forehead and side of nose This is a MIRACLE worker for my skin It will NOT get RID of pores its not made for that It will sublimate your skin to give the impression they are gone They will contribute to diminish their size You cannot get rid of pores they will not get smaller as pores do not have muscles that contracts or dilates them They will get bigger if they are clogged and not cleaned on a regular basis so if you think this will get rid of your pores it is not the right product for you If you want skin that feels amazingly soft and allow your makeup to glide over the pores  then this is the most

used this for over a year and the slight lines I had in my forehead did diminish in appearance I thought it may be a fluke so I change to something else for a while and I noticed a difference While this wont remove wrinkles completely lets be honest only Botox can do that it does help with smoothing things out Its also very luxurious feeling it melts into your skin and makes it feel super soft I also like that the smell is not super strong\\nread more It smells amazing and it made my skin visibly brighter I have always struggled with clear skin and acne scars but after using this product I

great way to keep Vitamin C stable I mix with a clear non greasy serum and use under make up This brand has been around for a long time and for good reason Me I honestly never cared to try any of the products and I honestly dn why until recently It was always there but I feel like its just one that nobody ever really talks about but as you notice they always have the best reviews so that should speak for itself Oddly enough somehow my whole skincare routine has now ended up philosophy It all started with renewed hope in a jar that I bought simply because it was a good dealfacewash clay mask and spf moisturizer and I absolutely fell in love with how well it worked I pair this with the renewed hope in a jar every morning and I use the help me retinol at night I honestly have never felt

hyped up products that others rave about but never end up giving me any real results but can only somehow take the leap with these Im so tired of buying and returning products or wasting money on

seems to help my moisturizer work better too I love that I can add this product to my cream Hands down the best at lightening sun spots on my face Have used for exactly 1 week and while putting on my makeup I noticed the pesky sun spots Ive tried to get rid of the past few months are very much faded The first day I only mixed half a scoop just to make sure it didnt irritate my face After that I have used 1 scoop mixed in the The Ordinarys Buffet in the mornings My face looks a lot more radiant with this combo I cant wait to see how much more my skin improves with continued use Highly highly recommend\\nread more A definite staple product for me My favorite serum of all time is when hope is not enough from philosophy I add a scoop of this every morning and then Can use the serum alone in the evening It works perfect for me absolutely amazing product I saw results within two days of using it mixed in with glycerin and rose water The only con is of the plastic scooper which is hard to use and wastes product at times This stuff is amazing I used to have severe acne and because of that I was left with a lot of hyperpigmentation and this stuff has done wonders to get rid of it Not only that but I notice that my skin is more plump and healthy looking after using it I use two pumps every night and the 05oz bottle lasts me a good 5 months The bottle says it expires after 12 months so I wouldnt recommend getting anything larger then 1oz\\nread more Love this serum my face feels so much healthier with it Got it as a sample but in one use I could notice the difference My skin was glowing and I looked so fresh today I barely feel this with other products I use one of my favourite serums The smell is wonderful I have combination skin My skin is always dry and flaky after washing

Ive used not sticky at all and smells great Ive used 3 of the 30 ml ones already definitely a product I will continue to repurchase This is my favorite serum Have purchased multiple times I dont leave the house without this on underneath my moisturizer Highly recommended for my 40 peeps Did its job  I bought this mainly for its purpose of helping dark spots and brightening the skin I used it for about 3 weekssince I got the mini size and Ive had these dark spots on the sides of my face FOREVER that always looked like super bad bronzer  And the spots were completely gone  I absolutely love this and the smell is amazing Only prob is that Im all about clean beauty now and this isnt clean so Ive stopped using it but even to this day almost a year later those spots are still lighter then

coming up soon too would definitely recommend to anyone This is my favorite product in my entire skincare routine You can instantly feel it working as soon as you apply it Skin feels lifted and firmer almost immediately I use the Truth Serum at night and by morning my skin especially along my jaw looks tighter Its a face lift in a bottle Im in my midlate 20s normal skin with pigmented acne scars that look like current breakouts but arent raised or textured When I first started at Sephora I noticed this was one of our topselling serums and did some research Some people seemed to have good results with pigmentation whether its age spots acne scarring or other marks I made a sample for myself and holy crap I loved it My scars are less pigmented than they were before with daily use for about six weeks now Theyre not gone and this wont erase them by any means But theyre less red for sure More than anything though this serum FEELS so good I havent found another serum that almost sets ontointo your skin the way this does A really unique texture and feel If youre considering it at least go get a sample and see what you think\\nread more Let me just say SKINNN After a week of using this product twice a day Ive noticed a difference in my skins natural appearance This serum will give your face a natural highlight glow especially during the summer days Treat yourself Received so many complements on my skin after only a few days of using this product Had previously used the drunk elephant vitamin C serum this is so much better A staple in my skincare routine Seriously the best serum Ive ever used Ive been using this for about a month now and while my skin definitely went through a purging stage for about two weeks the breakouts have mostly subsided and I am noticing my skin looking much brighter and healthier Dark spots from acne scars have begun fading away which was something I didnt think could actually happen A little goes a long way with this stuff  I bought a travel size just to try and even after using every day for a month I still have about 13 remaining  and I find that it applies best immediately after washing the face My skin absorbs it pretty quickly too and it smells wonderful I will definitely be purchasing a large bottle after this mini finally runs out\\nread more After going through 2 deluxe sample sizes of this I finally purchased the bigger size Its a great brightening serum HOLY GRAIL cannot go without this product has seriously improved my rosacea This is in my holy grail products I dont think Ill ever stop buying it I cannot believe how much this brightens my face and helps keep it clearer I struggle a lot with acne but have found that a chemical exfoliate really makes a difference and this is the best of the best I use this a few times per week and then use the Sephora peeling pads in between uses to save a little  Love the results So for reference I have very pale sensitive red splotchy skin I have large pores and break out a lot I recently starting following the K beauty 10 step routine and included these 23x a week in place of an exfoliant Since I use a bunch of things on my face its hard to credit the improvement to just one product BUT Ive been using the extra moisture from these pads on my décolletage area and nothing else and I couldnt believe the difference The redness is almost completely gone and its so smooth I couldnt believe it especially because I was just using left over product and didnt think so little product would make a difference\\nread more Really great Its very intense and i use it maybe twice a week because I have dry skin but it definitely helps my skin stay clear and smooth This product is extremely effective if you have up to two days to clear your skin I swear by using this two days back to back for those stubborn blemishes that you get during your time of the month Ive noticed a big difference in less than a week I dont normally buy products twice unless I really love them  This is one amazing product Ive watched my skin transform before my eyes  This is it My holy grail of skincare I have had some terrible cystic acne for the last six months that I chalked up to my skin changing as I got older yippee I tried adding in a retinoid product the DE one which helped some but not until I went through a horrible skin purge where I was left covered in acne scars and still had some painful spots And after using this product every other day for the last month there is a bright light at the end of the tunnel I am finally hopeful that I will get my once clear skin back and it is 100 because of this product Is it expensive Shoot yeah Is it worth it to me Double shoot yeah\\nread more Love this product but I have a question May seem silly but instructions dont specify After step 2  do you rinse your face with water or leave the chemicals on Thanks This is one of my holy grail products that I have been using for almost a year I would grab this and my tretinoin in a fire The only downside of this product is that it is very expensive It has noticeably improved the texture of my skin I have a sensitive neck and chest so can only use this product on my face Before I started using tretinoin I used this product at night along with a Dr Dennis Gross Retinol product The texture and appearance of my skin improved dramatically I started using tretinoin retin A  about a month ago so I switched to using these peel pads in the morning As many have suggested I cut these in half since I can only use them on my face\\nread more I have always struggled with finding foundations I always would blame the foundation itself when it turns out my skincare was just lacking I have extremely dry skin which has turned into extremely textured skin This was making any foundation applied have scales look no matter how light or hydrating it was Since using these daily my complexion has improved my face is so much smoother fine lines have become duller and my skin tone is more even without any blemishes I am obsessed They are quite expensive especially if you use them daily like I do A tip is to cut them in half every other day and keep the other half in the package and inside a ziplock for use the next day\\nread more This is the BEST I received a sample in my Boxy subscription and fell in love I purchase the 30 treatments right away Now I use them every day My skin has never looked more balanced and perfect I used to never leave the house without makeup  now I feel like I look actually pretty without makeup on wow What a difference this stuff makes Worth every penny I promise you that You will LOVE your skin\\nread more Really solid product I find my face doesnt really have nearly as frequent break outs when I use it Will repurchase These pads are so easy to use and as the name implies they are highly effective These are not for those with sensative skin or a compromised skin barrier try the universal daily pads But powerfully treat uneven skin tone smooth surface texture and banish mild inflammation for glowy looking skin I only use these at night 23 times a week The keep my skin clear and provide me with nearly every active I wantAHA BHA Vitamin C retinol etc This box will likely last me 6 months\\nread more I absolutely loved this product the first week of using these I could already see a difference a little pricey but they last a while and I think they are well worth the price highly recommend I had really bad scarring from previous acne outbreaks that I had a really hard time getting rid of I started using this every other day and it has made a HUGE difference in my scarring most of it on its way to being almost completely gone I havent noticed any adverse reactions or increase in outbreaks since starting this product Definitely worth checking out if youre like me and have tried everything under the sun to get rid of dark spots and acne scarring\\nread more Love these I dont use them every day Every 2 days is what Ive been doing and I feel like its accomplishing the job I never felt a tingle when I used them at the beginning either The woman at Sephora I spoke to said there would be a major tingle I feel like the smoothness and texture of my skin has improved Really happy with all the products Ive used in this line My friend with acne scars swore by this and said this how she got rid of her pigmentation I bit the bullet and paid 88 for the 35 treatments Its only been a week but I have seen major improvements I cant say its 100 this product because I have also made lifestyle changes eating healthy and drinking water and added thing to my routine such as gentle face wash hydrating toner and water based hydrating face lotions My pores are a bit smaller and my skin is less red and irritated The texture of my skin has changed for the better and my makeup goes on better I use these every night but I noticed it was starting to burn a bit too much on my tzone So I cut the pads in half and some nights just apply it to my scars avoiding my Tzone Like I said it has just been 1 week but if the results continue to improve I will be using these forever\\nread more These are amazing SUPER easy to use and Very effective I se one every few days and my skin feels cleaner tighter smoother and healthier It has helped my completion as well Looking to try more Dr Dennis products if the rest exfoliate like this one I just started the peel but I love it already I cant wait to see the results I used this every night for 30 days It improved the texture of my skin and helped even out my complexion It took about 5 days for my skin to get adjusted to the pads and I saw some redness but after that everything was good My holy grail Ive been using this for years It removes the white bumps on my forehead and helps even my skin tone With they made a super jumbo size Have definitely seen the difference in my skin This has really clarified and made my skin so smooth Ufffff is really good change completely the way that my skin look is awesome 100 recommend If I had to choose only one skin care product this would be it I have combination skin and the dry areas are super dry and the oily areas are super oily There is no in between Also I have a lot of sun damage and dark spots from years of tanning I love most of Sunday Riley products but this is the holy grail I use it almost everyday and my dull skin is noticeably lighter and its no longer too dry or too oily It lightened my dark spots and evened out my complexion Im over 50 and I do have some wrinkles I have tried several products and none of them made much of a difference Good Genes plumped up my skin and reduced the fine wrinkles considerably Its pricey but worth every penny\\nread more I have sensitive skin and Ive found over the years that sticking to basics tends to work best I heard about Sunday Riley Good Genes in my late 20s when my skin was all over the place and I have used it every day since I got my first sample Its seriously a miracle product I genuinely look 5 years younger Ive had smile lines since I was a kid and this erases them I dont get breakouts anymore and my skin usually looks flawless Its expensive but the large bottle lasts 45 months so its not bad\\nread more This is one of those staples in my daily skincare routine If I run out I see the difference in my skin tone I literally glow after using this Blemish free Love this product I have very dry and sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin at all After one use I immediately noticed a difference in the texture of my skin My skin felt so much smoother I only use this product at night because I use a Vitamin C serum Ole Henriksen Truth Serum in the morning and I dont want to risk destabilizing my Vitamin C This product is amazing I started off using it only at night but now I use it in the AM as well My skin is so clear soft and supple as a result and I love the smell I generally wouldnt spend this much on a treatment but I received a sample in my Allure Beauty Box and it changed my skin overnight so I had to get it This is by far the best Lactic Acid out there  It works soo good its a everyday skin care item I use  Your skin will look amazing and feel even better  Also I have sensitive skin and this works fine  I love exfoliating My skin was a pink sensitive mess My aesthetician said to cut it out and try an acid Chose this one and I feel like my skin is transformed I use it every night Its creamier than a lot of serum type products Goes on smooth I follow it up a few hours later with a night cream or oil Love it I have less redness smoother skin and even get skin compliments from coworkers Im very happy and will continue to use FYI it took a week plus to see major improvements but it did seem like my skin looked more even toned in the morning within days of use\\nread more Miracle in a bottle I have been using the Good Genes treatment every morning and night My face has changed for the better My dark spots are gone and my skin looks smooth which was never the case I get compliments all the time about how clear my skin looks I have already purchased my 2nd bottle The one ounce lasted about 23 months for me This is amazing I saw immediate results My skin was so so smooth and very glowy This product had me feeling super fine with no makeup on I received this sample product free with a Sephora purchase I made I received the 7 day trial It did tingle on my face when I first started using it My skin adapted quick to this product I havent bought the full size as of yet Im a little nervous to buy the full size A lot of people are saying the trial samples and the actual formula are two completely different formulas Hmmthis product is to expensive to risk that I dont know if Ill buy full size based off that\\nread more I got a 7 day sample and after 2 uses all my texture was gone It did tingle and my face redend up at first but stopped after 15 minutes and didnt happen on any other applications I bought this after that sample Yes it smells but I got over that after my face looked amazing The occasion acne I get always leaves scars and takes at least a week and a haft to go away Probably because I pick at it but they are always the big red swollen painful ones The last time I felt one coming on I decided to try these Gone in 3 days enough said And yes Ive tried other spot treatments These are literally amazing You put on the zit it pulls out the gross stuff and its gone Im such a bad compulsive scratcher so this helps me sooooo much These things definitely work They work best on acne thats already been popped even though youre not supposed to we all do it and they still work amazing on pimples under the surface Whether theyre just starting to form theyre ready to blow or theyve been red blemishes on your face for a while these dots clear acne up crazy fast Absolutely love these I always get hormonal acne and I put one these dots on after I wash my face and its calmed down so much or completely gone They would be super easy for teens and younger kids to use too because its literally just a sticker on the face and its super gentle I even put them on my occasional chest spot too and leave in on all day and its gone after I take it off I love these things I always have them in my travel bags and in the bathroom and some at my moms house when I go there for a weekend and a back up pack because theyre so cheap and so easy to use Im always super happy I have them on hand\\nread more Seriously amazing these are the real deal so easy to use and yes A sticker really CAN get rid of my cystic breakouts Im in LOVE This is by far my favorite face product It works so well and so fast I usually put a dot on overnight and its so satisfying to see the white come through I highly recommend this product I got all the ladies in my family using this as well Im inpatient so I prefer to use benzoyl peroxide and BHA for treating a red and closed breakout I only use this patch when the breakout ruptures or when I pop it I make sure all the gunk is out clean the area with some antiseptic and then put this patch on It prevents the open wound from developing a dark and hard crust which takes more than a week to come off It also calms down any residual Inflammation overnight When I take it off in the morning the redness and swelling are usually gone or very minimal and I can cover up the area with concealer smoothly without the texture making it more prominent Overall it makes the healing process much faster Combined with regular exfoliation and azaleic acid the postacne marks remain red for a few days before disappearing completely Its quite expensive but it has been the best acne patch Ive used\\nread more I cant remember if Ive reviewed these before but they are great Very effective  especially if you can get them on in the early stage of a pimple It will reduce how large it gets And if you get it during a whitehead stage it will take care of it extremely quickly I always have these on hand So far the best acne healing and clearing product Ive ever used Did as instructed and applied them and wore over night until I was ready to leave the house lol Clear up the pimple and also cleared up the redness after 23 times of use my pimple disappeared always work keep them on as long as possible and when you take them off your skin will be perfect These are truly a Godsend along with Cliniques Charcoal Masque and Kate Sulfur Blemish treatment I cant believe how much they have made my face clear up over night little by little These are little miracles expensive miracles but you gotta try them Ive tried all the acne healing dots from peter Thomas Roth to drug store brands This one takes the cake I think these are the most effective ones yet I had a huge zit on my chin I swear it was an okay eyesore I bought these and immediately put one on I can actually see the spot where your pimple is getting sucked out When I took it of there was a circle in the middle that looked full of oil My zit wasnt totally gone I tried to pop it before I got the treatment so there was some damage to my skin but it was no longer inflamed and I wasnt embarrassed to be in public I wish i had a before pic\\nread more Im not sure if Im right or if its placebo but I feel like the aloe in these does make my pimples less noticeable and red the next day as compared to a standard hydrocolloid acne patch These have always worked for me I usually put them on before bed and then in the morning you can see where the bacteria and gunk is pulled out of the skin and onto the patch I do sometimes use them to spot treat during the day if something has popped up randomly Its also really good for reducing the swelling of my acne as well Highly recommend Note I do have tend to have combination skin usually during the summer and more dry skin during the winter time If you have oily skin might not work as well And I dont usually break out unless its that time of the month Ive also noticed that if you pull off and try to reapply if you dont like where you placed it it doesnt stick as well so make sure youll like where itll be before sticking it onto your skin\\nread more I wouldnt recommend this product for cystic acne or acne thats below the surface of the skin However for topical acne this stuff is an absolute miracle I usually put some on my spots before I sleep and then peel them off in the morning and theyre always full of gunk from my skin and my acne is dramatically reduced This is one of my most repurchased items and I love it OMG I wish i had these magical dots as a teenager They dont work as well for deep painful cystic acne but they will reduce their redness More to the head acneinsane I usually wear them to bed after deep cleansing my skin and take them off in the AM Amazing and pick up a box every time Im in Sephora An incredible product Mix with my concealers and tinted moisturizers for additional aid with dryness and blending into skin for a more natural dewy look Purchased twice now Writing this review because I know how much I rely on reviews when I purchase a new product Highly recommend I am so in love with this serum and mix it with the CFirma Day Serum for my morning routine and with Shiseidos Ultimune Serum for my night routineduring winter months when I need the extra hydration and I love the added hydration without the heavy greasy residue As an influencer I try many different serums gels creams etc from many brands but Drunk Elephants B Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum has given me a new love A serum moisturizer Still blows my mind in the BEST way Its light and refreshing and doesnt leave my skin sticky greasy or icky feeling at all actually the complete opposite and my skin looks awesome since I started and continue to use it A little goes a long way as well as your serum you mix with it so itll last forever Just to noteYou do not have to mix it with another serum cream gel if you dont want or need to and it works just as great for hydrating your skin A definite must add to your skincare regimen I was happily surprised to see brighter healthier looking skin after the first day and then by the 1st week then 2nd week I was completely sold and will continue to keep this in my skincare Arsenal I absolutely love the JuiceC Water Smoothie Voxbox I received and am now a happy and proud Drunk Elephant user I did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes drunkinlove\\nread more Really enjoying this product Its

breakouts or anything My skin is very sensitive and this helped it a lot Would highly recommend This product is hydrating absorbs quickly my skin is loving it I start using this for over a year and I love it Im going to keep using it Thats one of my favorite Drunk Elephant products I keep repurchasing it because its super hydrating and its great if used in combination with basically any other product not just Drunk Elephant I usually use it in the morning with a hydrating cream sometimes at night with a resurfacing creamserum Also the amount of product is more than usual for a serum 50ml many serums are 30ml The only downside is that you cant see how much product is left\\nread more I love this serum Very lightweight and keeps my skin hydrated all day long I absolutely love this stuff When I started using drunk elephant I now use the whole line I had extremely oily skin Like my makeup was sliding off my face in an hour oily skin I use 2 pumps of this serum morning and night mixed with either Protini or Lala Retro and my skin has never felt so balanced I no longer have oily skin This serum and DE in general has solved what I feel are the root issues that lead to overproduction of oil proper hydration absorption etc and my skin has never felt so good I cant recommend the B Hydra Serum and DE products highly enough to those who have dealt with extremely oily skin Ive bought at least 45 bottles of this stuff and will continue to buy again and again Just keep in mind this is NOT a moisturizer This gets used in combination with a moisturizer\\nread more LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS

to pull my differing skin types in closer to normal all around my face The serum is lightweight and I only need one pump to cover my entire face I do need to use this everyday otherwise my forehead

just makes my skin look very glowy with just a few drops I love the small brown bottle it nourishes my skin I have suffer of Acne since I was 10 an it took me 13years to finally find something that would stop it completely I have no break out in 3 months ever since I got it and it feels so good it is a little pricey but it is worth it If you have really sensitive skin I would recommend this Nothing feels the same on the skin The texture is sooooo smooth nice consistency feels luxurious light weight on the skin and is absorbed by the skin very fast  Two thumbs up  according to my wife it is a very good product I bought two for her I have been hearing alot about this product and I took the plunge It is very hydrating and luxurious but not sticky my husband used it and also noticed a difference the next morning This will be a restock item I have been using this product for a week now It completely melts into your skin with no oily or greasy residue left on your skin I actually

worsens throughout the day This completely keeps my makeup looking fresh with less oil buildup in T zone area This completely changed my makeup routine forever\\nread more This serum is holy grail for me I was hesitating between this and Lancomes advanced genifique serum which both contains Bifida and are always compared in terms of their efficacy and similarities within each other I am glad that I chose Estee Lauder as I believe working as a hydrating and repair serum the addition of alcohol and perfume in Lancomes is just ridiculous As I am a fan for BHA AHA and retinol my face can sometimes break out and be sensitized a little The day I applied this serum before my radical skincare ingredients I found all what concerned me beforeacnes sensitization were all gone in just as short as one night This serum does not clog my pores nor break me out no matter how much I apply on my face It is so wonderful in fixing problematic skin issues and can hydrating your skin without feeling greasy\\nread more Love this product and I can see a difference in my skin I have a seen improvement in my skin fine lines are less visible and people have commented on the glow This is my first time ever to write a review and I just want to tell you people that THIS SERUM HELPS MY SEVERE ACNE AND ACNE SCARS on my forehead a lot I was swearing on my face because I had no confidence at all and cries a lot BUT when I started using this July I already saw the unexpected result that leads me to buy it again It literally removed my acne scars and my acnes started to stop growing Thank God Ive been using this serum for 5 months now and it is really worth the price I have tried a lot of facials before microneedling microdermabrasion and so on and spent thousand of dollars until I found this I would use this until I die lol\\nread more I purchased this along with the Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Complex from Estee Lauder and I am so glad I did Literally magic in a bottle It feels wonderful going on and sinks into your skin immediately making it ideal for us who love to layer out skin care products my skin is beginning to appear more even toned and my fine smile lines reduced it has been 2 weeks so far and I am loving the results\\nread more I am 30 years old and thanks to modern medicine have enjoyed mostly clear skin for the last few years I try to do things naturally so foolishly went cold turkey on my acne medicine Cue forehead breakout explosion For months my forehead has been covered in red bumps and cystic acne I am back on medicine now and the breakouts are slowly starting to subside but the red marks left behind are everywhere I did not feel like I could leave the house without makeup I went to Sephora and asked what they recommended and came home with a 5 pack of these peels to try OMG After ONE use I could see a huge difference The acne I had was smaller and the red marks were significantly less noticeable I have used them twice now and cant wait to keep going I think these will be a new staple for me\\nread more I got this peel to combat hyperpigmentation aka pink marks left behind from acne I kid you not I have a difference in one use I have continued to use daily for about a week and a half My skin is softer brighter and those annoying acne marks are smaller and fainter I will continue to use and repurchase Work the investment in my opinion Im getting older late 40s and this stuff literally takes my skin back a few years Shrinks pores and makes my skin look smoother I originally recieved a sample from a family member to try out After one treatment I was in love with the way my skin felt I purchased an entire box I have had lessno breakouts since using on a regular basis If I do a deep exfoliation before applying the treatment there is light burning and redness but as I had expected nothing uncomfortable I have recommended this product to others and will likely repurchase\\nread more I loved this product I bought it to help with some dark pigmentation around my lips and after the first use there was a small but noticeable difference I had better results with one use of this product than a month of using dark spot cream different brand If I could only ever have one skin care product this would be it I would give everything else up to keep this I used to have heaps of bumps near my lip on my chin Around 30 small bumps Tried heaps of products This is the only one that worked within a few uses Tingles if your new to this but its gentle but does an amazing job Would highly recommend I have only been using these for a week but I am loving them so far My face was glowing after one use and felt tight These are quite pricy but in order to get the most value I also use them on my chest and back There is plenty of product on the wipe to do so Cant wait to see my results after all 35 treatments I love DrDennis Gross products They really truly work These peels changed my skin I used them for about a year Years and years ago when I worked at Sephora my skin was so bad mostly due to hereditary cystic acne passed down from my mom I was so afraid it would keep progressing and that I would need to go on acutane like my mom Something I was hoping to avoid at all costs because it can be quite intense on your body Luckily I learnt so much about this brand and had many many colleagues tell me that this specific brand will do miracles They were right I have used the ferulic acid and retinol pads night time the original formula day time and once a week I used to do the medispa peels same strength as Dr Dennis uses in his office For the past two years my skin was amazing I stopped buying the peels because my skin got so good Now I am engaged and super super stressed out about my wedding Im having some skin issues again Im not worried though because I know that these peels will be a quick month or two fix and my skin will be all balanced again I dont work for Sephora anymore but if I did this would still be my number one recommendation for women wanting smoother brighter clear poreless looking skin Pro tip you can cut the pads in half and stick the other half in the fridge and get two days Or use the full thing and also use the pads on your hands Keep your hands and neck as youthful as your face Use the pad till its basically dry that way you get the most use out of it\\nread more Love this product I call it my lazy mask So easy and no mess Bought these so many times and they never disappoint Honestly these are a game changer for me They really help clear my skin up and make my skin tone even So so so good I had been struggling with texture and blackheads on my nose for the last year I tried blackhead removing strips Murads multi acid peel Origins charcoal mask and soooo many other things but nothing worked These pads howeverONE use got rid of 75 of the texture on my nose and the rest of my face Ive tried both the Extra Strength and Universal peels by DDG and as these are now a permanent part of my routine I settled on universal just because I dont think my skin needs such intense treatment on a daily basis Highly highly recommend\\nread more I have purchased this multiple times 3 times in the 5 pack and loved it so much I decided to take the next big step and purchase the 30 day supply My skin is able to be renewed at home and feels great while giving me the glow I love to see i use at least once a week and results are great every time My moisturizer works much better using these daily This is handsdown the best skincare product I have ever spent money on I wish I took before and after photos The past few months my usually tame but very sensitive skin started breaking out leaving scars and having noticeable discoloration to the point I was wearing foundation every day so I didnt have to see it Im sure that didnt help at all So in desperation I started using these Dr Gross pads first every other day then daily Now after a month of using the pads my skin looks great scars have faded skin tone has evened out and I now love leaving the house without foundation HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OUT OF THIS PRODUCT  The slight tingling sensation after putting on Step 1 may feel weird at first but its expected since it is a peel Like the instructions say use the product every other day if it feels too much  USE SUNSCREEN This should be a given every day but its especially important with this product You can actually damage your skin if you use this product without applying skinscreen  I personally like applying this product in the evening but the instructions say you can use it in the AM  PM\\nread more Must have leave skin so smooth and soft Helps with blackheads too Its lil pricy if use everyday but 100 worth it why why must you be so amazing Hate that I need them in my life Ive tried so many different products that are supposed dupes and none come close They are truly the best I found I broke out a lot when I started but decided to wait it out and found it overall did reduce my acne after that first breakout Id definitely suggest working your way up to every day slowly if you have dry skinI have combination skin and a lot of acne scarring and saw positive results in only 2 weeksthe texture of my skin is smoother and brighter and my pores look way smaller Love these I have sensitive skin so I was a bit nervous to try these but despite the first initial stinging they are actually quite gentle on the skin and its helped with my dark spots and acne scarring Definitely recommend Worth the splurge Im constantly buying new products and Im all about skincare This will 100 be a part of my everyday routine I received a sample in the Sephora hydration sample kit and I immediately went online to buy the full size Glad I found a product that is officially part of my starting lineup I use it every morning and every night After one week Ive noticed clearer skin Super moisturizing without the stickiness Great during the cold dry winter months Totally fine in the summer too I dont use a lot I like to use it under makeup when my skin is dry so my foundation doesnt look flakey on my skin I bought the 100mL size exactly a year ago and Im only halfway done with the bottle Its the star product of the sea blue mystery It keeps my skin in good condition My skin is very dry in the winter because of the climate here in Texas so Im eager to try new things After only one day of using this I noticed amazing results It made my skin so much softer and smoother The price is a little steep compared to other products but for the results I had from using this for only one day I totally recommend it I love how a little goes a long way with this product My skin feels and looks better after using this The only thing I would change would be the way its dispensed a pump would be better This product is just amazing  its little pricey but it worth the money  Im on my third bottle of this  Its my absolute must part of skin care Dont buy the cream if you have oily skin buy this or the lotion  gel version of the moisturizing cream This leaves skin very soft and oil control You have to use it for a while to see the result skin texture improves and heals acne fast and fades fast The key is to keep using it One bottle last long time I use it more than 4 times a week the biggest bottle last me almost a year Worth the money\\nread more Ive been wanting to buy this since trying a sample from Le Mer Bought during the VIB sale good value Glad I got the full size Good product left my skin soft and feeling refreshed Watery treatment is the first and foremost step of my skincare regimen This lotion is an indispensable member of my skincare army I love this stuff It really goes on well soaks into my skin and smooths out my lines and wrinkles It helps plump up my skin and works great with my other products The more I use it the more I notice a difference I feel like its a great prep for the skin before moisturizer Its worth the price for the ingredients and how my skin feels Amazing product it really hydrates your skin the skin absorbs the product quite fast I dont use a cotton pad to apply it I apply it with my fingertips its worth the price and the bottle lasts a long time A must buy The best lotion for my skin This with the soft cream is just awesome Let me just say that my skin has never looked better This is large part due to LaMer My LaMer journey began in Jan of 2019 with the original cream To my surprise and future financial dissatisfaction I immediately saw results Since then I have added this the renewal oil and the perfecting treatmentcream This routine has given me the best skin of my adult life I started getting severe adult acne in my early 20s With some diet changes no dairy or eggs I saw some improvement but nothing as revolutionary as using this skincare routine in conjunction with my beloved paulas choice BHA liquid exfoliant and my HUM Nutrition regimen I have never had perfect skin and probably never will but if you are serious about investing in your skin I would highly recommend every product named above Let me not understate the important of having a healthy internal balance to promote healthy skin but when it comes to topicals there is a reason LaMer is considered to be the gold standard Soothing redness reducing acne calming you name it I honestly will not and cannot go back from here The gains have been too monumental for me personally In case you are wondering this is the routine that changed my skin from textured and red to smooth and calm PM Jose Maran argan oil cleanser Ole Hendrickson apricot physical exfoliant It cosmetics cleanser After shower Paulas Choice BHA liquid exfoliant LaMer treatment lotion LaMer renewal oil LaMer cream original This may seem like a bit much but this triple cleansing works well for me Baby soft skin AM Wash with warm water only Paulas choice liquid BHA exfoliant amazing at getting rid of texture and transforming skin for a smooth makeup application LaMer treatment lotion Mix 2 drops LaMer renewal oil and small amount of LaMer perfecting treatmentlotion Ready for my It cosmetics CC cream\\nread more Love this to prep the skin If your trying to use this line  this is a must along with the moisturizer Its worth it  Its very hard to describe what I felt about it I finished my bottle already Overall I think it is a great treatment lotion by calming my skin a lot I used to have oily skin now more like normal skin it helped balance oil and hydrate my skin a lot I didnt see any glowing or magic after using this but I was happy about its calming function A few drops is all you need its like pure silky hydration It makes my skin feel so soft and plump it will also last a long time a few drops is all you need Love love love I love how hydrating this is compared to IOPE BioEssence SKII and other similar treatment lotions It is just slightly thicker in the texture but the hydration goes deeper and holds longer than other products La Mer has to be the worst thing that has happened to my bank account All of their skincare products just have amazing results on my skin Highly recommend and will buy it again Omg Worth it I finally purchased this badass during Rough Sale I can totally tell the different by using this Lamer Lotion within a week My acne blemish skin calmed down dramatically I only use about 23 drops and it covers entire face Dont waste it on cotton pad just put on my palm gently tap it on my face after my cleanser Feels little sticky at first but went away afterward Very light sense feel luxurious I use this toner morning and night Im sure this bottle will last me for a while Definitely will repurchase again in future I normally use ArmorePacific Essence after the toner but might opt to this lotion going forward\\nread more If I could have a gallon container of this stuff it would be great Love the consistancy and the spa smell Does it have curative qualities no but it feels so good Love this Because its pricey I tend to reserve this for my rainy days ie when my skin just looks blah or when Ive overexfoliated Its incredibly nourishing and feels like Im applying a protective second layer of skin It has a velvety finish and just feels luxurious Scent is pleasant too My favourite LA Mer product You will only need to use a tiny amount at a time so get the smallest size as it will last you This product is exceptional at accelerating post pimple healing I have fairly clear skin but everyone gets pimples now and again I first tried this on an unprecedented double pimple on my chin that had not healed after months Within a few days the residual was noticeably smaller Incredible This is the stuff Magic in a bottle My daughter had some minor acne scars and I bit the bullet and bought some Her skin is GORGEOUS It is killing me to buy a second bottle but I will buy this for her for eternity based on the results we have had I wish it wasnt so pricy because Id sure like a bottle for myself Listen I wish it didnt work as well as it does I wish it was just hype Then I wouldnt have to justify dropping this much money on a product But the fact of the matter is this stuff is magic in a bottle and makes my skin glow I use it nightly because if I overmoisturize in the morning my makeup doesnt apply properly Relevant note there are tons of comments on the La Mer website complaining that the package design leaves a bunch of product in the bottle Yes its true and yes its ridiculous for a product with such a high price tag to continue with a bad design after customer complaints but people Take matters into your own hands If you dont have a product spatula to get the last of a product out of the bottle get one The last 20 of this pricey serum is well worth the expense Anyway The unfortunate truth is it works and now Im stuck dropping 400 on bottles of the stuff Just remember a little goes a long way Thats the perk of La Mer its so potent you can make one bottle or jar last forever\\nread more Super expensive and I wasnt sure it was actually worth it One day I got a sunburn and it actually healed the burn overnight Ok that is proof enough for me Sold but I use sparingly Cant live without Makes a difference and everyone can tell when I am not using it Smells great smooth skin and fine lines Decreases redness There is nothing in the world that could ever compare to The Concentrate by La Mer It is magic in a bottle simply put I can guarantee that any poor reviews are misleading and inherently false Do not use a sample stores have a tendency of not discarding them after the expiration date The shelf life from production is approximately two years all of which is traceable through the lot number on the boxes La Mer makes their products very transparent and the maximum potency well known with each hand made batch traced back to the exact lab and scientist that created it You cant put a price on flawless skin its what everyone is searching for and The Concentrate delivers on every promise\\nread more my skin had always been my biggest insecurity and frustration i would never go out in public without any foundation or concealer because of my acne scars acnes redness uneven texture my skin was always bumpy when people see me without makeup they would ask if Im ok and why my face look so red _ until ive been using this consistently with creme de la mer for a while now and people around me keep saying i look better without makeup and i never get the are you okay comment anymore i dont need to spend hours doing and stressing out about makeup anymore i had seen dermatologist and had gotten prescription meds and ointments in the past and none of that did anything for me This product surprised me \\nread more Ill be honest when I first received this item as a sample I didnt want to like it The price point is so high I was hoping it was all hype No it is everything they say it is Lightened my healing blemish scars overnight I loved it so much I splurged on a big bottle The texture is similar to a face primer and the scent is such a dense lavender that I almost didnt recognize it as lavender at first Smell and texture aside its worth the hype\\nread more Its a big price tag for a little bottle but it really is amazing Ive been using it for about a month and feel like my skin just looks younger The texture of my skin is better and little fine lines are softened to the point of being almost invisible It isnt doing much for dark spots etc but given the overall effect I have no complaints The texture is a little dry hard to explain but a little like a heavy mattifying base Ive used before so it helps to have a damp face via either a hydrating liquid or serum to help the concentrate spread out or just use the whole la Mer system if you can afford it \\nread more Like many reviewers before me I wanted to hate this product due to the price However after using it for two weeks it is amazing and I cant live without it My skin is so smooth and silk after application I have noticed that my pores arent as clogged and my skin texture just glows This is a must have product This glides over your skin like nothing else Ive ever felt It to me acts like a primer and making my skin looks so ready for makeup It creates a flawless canvas and just feels so luxe It is absolutely worth the money in my opinion love it This is the only dark spot remover that works I have sun spots from a sunburn last summer and this product is fading them fast Ive been disappointed with corrective solutions in the past so I was guardedly optimistic about this one To my delight it worked Ive been using it for about two months now and it continues to improve my skin I use it after cleaning with Caudalies Vinopore pore purifying gel It didnt take long to see results I use just a tiny bit so its a thin layer on my face mostly where I have acne scars AFTER my face has been washed in the morning and GOD this stuff is amazing It did take a while Id say maybe a few weeks probably cause they were so dark initially but after constant use my scars went away Obviously if I get new scars now I just continue putting this on but it works miraculously faster now Definitely be patient at first and dont slather this stuff on your face and you wont regret it\\nread more The product that summer likes to use most light spot effect is apparent At first I was skeptical of this product because I never heard of the brand nor do I know anyone that uses it but I fell in love with it Ive been using it for about 4 months and Ive seen drastic changes in my dark spots and overall skin appearance My skin is vibrant and soft though Im still working on the dark spots This is a must buy Life saver Im on accutane and this has been the game changer for helping with leftover hyperpigmentation and dark spots from purge breakouts Significant results after less than a week My overly sensitive skin turns read and itchy with most moisturizers serums face washes etc but this did not leave a single reaction I pair with Kiehls Ultra Facial Cream Worth every last penny It really works I notice my dark marks hyperpigmentation fading ever since using this product This is such a great product I use in the morning with my sunscreen and it gives such a great glow I never use a whole pump just a small squirt and its concentrated so it goes a long way Highly recommend I have mature pale skin so thought I would give this a try I have used it about half a dozen times now and do not use much but mix it in with other drunk elephant products to give my skin a very subtle bit of color I love what the Sunshine Drops do to my favorite sunscreen or moisturizer Its cut my application time down to nil and looks great with just a swipe of illuminating bronzer No foundation necessary Makes my skin look so good Gives my skin really nice color I always mix it with a gel and only really use a little because it goes a long way I love to add this to moisturizer or to my Kosas face oil for summer Adds a great glow also use it on its own for a bronzer Not sure how much this improved my skin but it definitely didnt hurt it and gives a great natural glow No issues with consistency when I mix it with serum primers foundation etc Blending this into my regular tinted moisturizer also saves me from having to change by base seasonally A little goes a long way and I am VERY happy with how long one tube has lasted I bought a second tube when I thought I was low and still havent opened it  that was two months ago\\nread more I adore this product I am a minimalist makeup wearer but I love the way my skin looks when it is golden tan I use this product as my everyday foundation It really minimizes the look of my blemishes without making my skin feel oily or clogging my pores Its the perfect amount of glow when you want to go makeup free Plus its antipollution so your skin is always protected I am a DBronzi fan I appreciate the antipollution properties since I live in a city They say you cant use this alone but if you are actually a brown person not a fair skinned person you can absolutely use it alone I do mix it with other products though I love how it just amps up my glow The difference between when I use it and when I dont is noticeable At least to me This is perfect for days when you wanna look like youre putting in an effort but also dont want to wear much makeup or any makeup at all Ill use this with a nice brow blush and highlight and Im good for the day\\nread more These are the only products so far in my life of trying so many different brands that do not make my skin break out As well as I get a Great glow with my tanned skin but fading tan on my face Love this product Give such vacation glow  I get so many compliments when I use this product I mix this product in with my La Mer Skintint It gives me a healthy natural glow I really like this product I take a little bit of my face moisturizer and mix it with a squirt of the sunshine drops its works great I am fair skin so it doesnt take much for me to have a little color I also have sensitive skin and this has not broke me out at all This stuff is versatile I know in the pictures it looks kinda shimmery but when you put it on it looks like a natural dewiness Its meant to be mixed in with one of your other regular products so depending on how you use it You can mix it it with body lotion and it gives a hint of bronze Im pasty white in winter Its also super great on your face and has a bunch of antioxidants Mix half a pump in with your foundation to look like maybe you saw the sun in the last day or two winter is the worst This also works for subtle contouring on warmer or neutral skin tones\\nread more Completely plumps up your skin making it appear fuller and super juicy Fills in my fine lines and makes them disappear perfectly With regular use this serum will have your skin going back 10 years however when you discontinue use the affects dont last more than a few weekswhich makes it ADDICTIVE Your skin just looks so much better with this product on it 2 days 2 days is all it needed to show a difference in my skin This product truly wowed me I love how rich and smooth it feels on my skin Very lightweight formula I have super oily large pores acneprone skin and was thinking this product wasnt going to have much of an impact on my skin All the recommendations I had received were from dryskin types so needless to say I was cautiously optimistic One night was all it took to set aside my reservations Day one my skin was hydrated and luminous not oily It applies like a dream I wish all my products felt this good I had gotten used to being disappointed by highend skin care that dont perform well on oily skin but this has actually delivered tangible results Ive been using it consistently day and night for two weeks and my skin is still hydrated and luminous but also fine lines are blurred pores seem smaller my overall texture seems more even Im sure some of my other products have definitely aided in all the improvements Ive seen but Im positive Genifique has helped my other products work more effectively My acne scars have also significantly faded and I havent had the same kind of breakouts since The price is steep but well worth every penny I am more than happy to pay for a product that delivers on its promises Thank you Lancôme\\nread more I love this stuffIt has became permanent part of my daily skin care regimen After trying the 7 day free sample I saw an immediate improvement in my skin It was brighter smoother and more youthful looking At 37 I feel my skin has never looked so good I cant say enough good things about this product I started using this when I received a 7 day sample and was instantly impressed with the results This serum truly brightens and tightens my skin no matter what it is going through Ie hangovers dry winter air etc I have noticed the biggest change around my eye area Im almost 30 and was starting to develop under eye wrinkles and this has really helped reduce those fine lines If youre on the fence give this a try it is worth every penny\\nread more 1st use  Im already hooked My skin is baby soft and Im loving it Personally Im not a fan of wearing makeup just mascara and a tiny eyebrow touch upeyeliner if Im feeling fancy so Im all about making sure my skin looks great Now Im just going to see how my skin looks over the next few weeks But I already love this product I can definitely see myself buying another bottle I really like how smooth and easy it glides on my skin I have smile lines so I apply it there and under my eyes It dries fast and I feel like it makes my skin smoother and more plump I get Botox and filler so Im not sure if it helps with fine lines Im only 36 but I was a smoker and Ive overused tanning beds for years But Ive also been using anti aging products since I was 20 to help retain my collagen and youth sorta working This serum feels very luxurious and I will continue to use it after my sample is used up Been about 4 weeks now My all time favorite face product though is Loccitaine divine youth oil Goes on same way but that one actually made my lines and dark spots disappear\\nread more I had received a sample of this product and loved it so much I had to order even with the high price point I am crazy about serums and the results start to show so quick on this that I had to have it This product is a definite serum staple It does everything it says it does without irritating my skin or causing breakouts After each use I wake up to more radiant skin Just be aware that you will need to give your skin a break because using it consecutively everyday will make your skin use to it and it will lose its effect Helps my skin feel as soft as a flower pedal I love using this product and would definitely recommend it I first received as a sample and I initially dismissed the product I have combo skin and dont really have any wrinkles I used on a whim one night and knew I would become hooked It moistures and causes your face to glow without becoming greasy Remarkable change in skin quality in just a few applications Notably more youthful and plump skin Decrease in wrinkles and other fine lines I didnt believe in the hype until I actually tried it Worth the investment A 30 mL bottle with twice a day application lasted me about 2 months I received this as a sample in Novembers Play box My daughter told me that its all the rage with Youtubers lol I read the reviews on here and was nervous about reacting to it since I have super sensitive skin I tried it on my forehead my only place of concern with aginghorizontal creasing and loose skin between eyebrows and on contact I saw tightening of my skin Applied again the next morning and am amazed by the change in texture on my forehead Fine wrinkling and loose skin have disappeared in 2 applications I used this under Protini and Lala Retro moisturizers I plan on updating this review after the bottle is empty and I buy a new one it seems a lot of people have better results with the sample than the retail bottle After damage to my skin from retinol this is truly the first thing to work in the past year and a half Im hopeful for even better results with regular use\\nread more I alternate between physical and chemical exfoliants so I dont use this everyday but it took a good 6 months to go through this The formula is great Some chemical exfoliants make me break out in tons of tiny red bumps everywhere eg Glossier toner but these havent bothered my skin at all If I thoroughly rub the pad all over it really does give me a glow I use these every night and love them I have dry sensitive skin and havent had any reactions They are a bit on the expensive side and Ive heard of people cutting them in half to make them go further but theyre kind of a pain to cut so I cant be bothered I dont mind paying a bit extra if something works Sometimes you get a better deal on these if you get them in a boxed set so check the prices because some of the promo sets come with them a bit cheaper and you get some other stuff that you may not need but if its free who cares\\nread more This is amazing especially for my makeup clients who need an extra bit of exfoliating to their skin These live up to the other reviews I rarely have had anything work like it says  but these do Im 41 and have better skin now than in my 30s Its clear and glowing minus the fine lines LOL I will be buying more from this linenew obsession  I love these They are so convenient and they do a great job at toning and exfoliating I suffered with melasma during pregnancy which exacerbated my eczema which turned into photosensitive eczema I take injections for my atopic dermatitis and am very limited in which ingredients I can use This stuff WORKS It helped to clear up the darkness left over from melasma and eczema scarring and has helped smooth the texture of my skin My mom asked me what I had done when I came downstairs immediately after the FIRST time I used these along with the face wash and repair cream I know these pads work because the discoloration extended into my ears and the pads are the only thing that I use in my ears Ive been using these pads ever since about 3 years\\nread more My skin has gotten really sensitive as Ive gotten older and these exfoliate but are gentle enough not to hurt my skin  I love them Ive never used an AHA before After my first night applying to my face I woke up with smoother skin and was SHOCKED It is gentle enough not to make my sensitive acne prone skin red and tight but potent enough to see an overnight difference These saved my face Winters are very cold and dry and my face was falling apart and these got rid of the dry skin I have fair sensitive acne prone skin Im also pregnant I have been using these pads for 2 months and my skin is looking great Ive done well in the past with glycolic and lactic acid based products so I knew this probably would not irritate my skin Im not sure if its a change in my hormones in the second trimester the use of this product or some combination of the two but skin is clear of breakouts and the texture is much improved Will continue using even after pregnancy\\nread more I love this exfoliating pads I noticed a difference almost immediately in my skin I found then gentle enough for everyday use I always get a few annoying little red spots particularly around my nose and chin and décolleté These pads INSTANTLY take them away though Ive been using these for about two weeks and I am in love They really do help brighten and tone the skin Im shocked at how fast Ive seen results My only concern with these though is their environmental impact as they are cotton pads that are being tossed in the trash Just something to think about\\nread more I hate that I love these The drugstore versions of these dont compare and the concentration of glycolic acid is low and theyre filled with fragrance which is super sensitizing I have VERY dry VERY sensitive skin and FAB just gets it right when it comes to sensitive skin Everyone needs a little exfoliation in their life but most acids make my skin burn and it turns red and blotchy These provide just the right amount of exfoliation without irritating my skin and the pads last WAY longer if you cut them in half I use them  3 nights a week using an acid every night can damage your skin barrier and both the big and small size of these pads last forever\\nread more Buy this product Its amazing I was looking for something alcohol and fragrance free to help with my acne and acne scars I was using this expensive PTR serum which was helpful for a bit bit eventually lost its effectiveness These pads have helped keep all my breakout in check diminishes scarring and gives me a nice glow Its a holy grail product I rarely get breakouts anymore and if I do they are gone almost immediately I use this with the FAB face moisturizer with a pump and the FAB pure skin cleanser My skin has never been better Just a tip do cut them in half They are very saturated and all you need is half\\nread more Such an effective yet gentle product Definitely keeps my skin clear and bright I love the convenience of this daily exfoliation and toner in one I can be super sensitive and this doesnt irritate Definitely worth it Travels well with me This product is promising Im seeing some visible difference in my toneits brighter and Im seeing some dark patches on my cheeks lightening up Cant wait to see what use of the whole bottle brings Soaks into skin and an actually skip moisturizer without noticing Great scent too Love this product My pores looks smaller and my skin is so smooth Yup its a winner Not sticky like some serums glides on great I use a rose quartz roller after I apply HIGHLY recommend Star product in the dry winter this essence effect is really great This one is my favourite I have dry skin and this serum can help me with this issue  Only product I have used that actually has reduced my dark spots My absolute favorite serum I love that its duel phased and that I can control how much product comes out with the top dial The scent is nothing offensive and I noticed a difference in my skin within the first week as well as got compliments by people asking what Ive been using This is great for anyone who is noticing any signs of aging and wants to start taking action I love that clarins products are made from plants as well\\nread more Honestly this product is worth every stupid penny I paid and I hate it because its so expensive But it has made my skin so beautiful I randomly got a sample of this one time and immediately had to buy it it was THAT good I have these slight wrinkles starting on my forehead and I

as a good brand then I tried this because of the reviews and I love it I purchased this after getting a sample from a sephora employee in store its a bit on the pricey side but i decided to give it a try i use this in combination with an essence My first reaction is it absorbs into my skin no sticky residue skin feels plump and hydrated instantly I decided to give this a try under makeup during the day my foundation with primer went on like a dream and stayed on it didnt break up Im pretty impressed my pores are noticeably smaller and my dry patchy areas are gone This is going to be another repurchase for me holy grail The results i got were long term not short term but with continued use\\nread more Ive been using this serum for a little over 2 months and its done wonders for my skin

serums Advanced night repair Genifique this is my holy grail serum I have probably used 20 bottles of this stuff by now no other serum works as well as this for me you can see results it makes your

booked an appointment for Botox with a plastic surgeon prior to buyingusing this serum I used it for a couple of months the surgeon is extremely popular and was booked a ways out prior to my

MILK hydrogrip I put it over top And oh my godmy pores are nonexistent My skin looks SO GOOD No porestexture showing through which is saying a lot for my skin AND my skin is matte in all the right areas Ive read a lot of reviews about how there isnt a lot of product in here so Ill be interested to see how long this lasts Im bummed about the price but if it lasts a while Ill totally shell out the cash for it This is honestly worth the hype No porefilling primer has ever gotten this reaction out of me I love it\\nread more i LOVE this product at first i was a little wary of farsali products as i thought it was a little gimmicky but i caves and bought this based on jackie ainas recommendation and it is tremendous you can literally see a difference as soon as you put it on if youre on the fence about buying it DO IT THIS IS YOUR SIGN I love the Farsali brand Ive used the gold elixir and couldnt get enough this is the first time using the primer and I dont know how Ive gone so long without it I put this over my face makeup I know thats not the intended use but I heard it works and it does I find it smoothes my makeup out and makes my face looks amazing in photos Amazing product and dose exactly what the description says This product is amazing When you apply this gel on your skin the dead skin cells actually ball up and exfoliate right off Its really great when my skin gets dry as it helps take all the flakes right off You only need this about once a week At first I wasnt sure if it was the product itself balling up or actual skin cells so I started testing it by using it a second time and there was barely any balling of the gel I highly recommend it\\nread more I got a sample of this awhile ago with a Sephora purchase and was instantly in love I havent found any other peel quite like it Doesnt feel drying or irritating either I dont write reviews often but this stuff is awesome It leaves your skin feeling so soft and exfoliated afterwards Ive tried so many exfoliants from scrubs to chemicals and nothing works like this Its also pretty cool how you literally feel the dead skin balling up I use it about once a week so one bottle lasts a while Definitely worth the price Love this peeling gel It works well on my oily skin and gently exfoliates it I have been using it for 2 years now tried so many exfoliants and this one is truly the best Skin feels soft and clean Pretty much anything ptr comes out with I love but this stuff is awesome You really feel like its doing the job its supposed to It made my skin feel softer even after the first use Its not a miracle worker even if I wish it was but it is very close to being one My boyfriend got me this and its just amazing You can see all the dead skins going away This stuff is amazing I dont do it that often but I do use it at least a couple of times a month When I first used it I wasnt expecting to have skin peeling all over my face but I guess I didnt really know what the mask was all about Now when using it I am still amazed with how much dead skin comes off Its almost gross but at the same time its awesome how well the product works My face feels amazing afterwards I would totally recommend this product to others and I will be purchasing again I started with a sample size and have moved to the full size and happy I did\\nread more Absolutely love this  going to purchase  This has become a staple in my daily premakeup routine Been using it for about 3 months I use it to get rid of any icky extra texture that tends to make my makeup look cakey or just not cleansmooth The product is super mild so I use it everyday after cleansing and toner and before any primer It makes such a huge difference in the appearanceOr less there of my foundation  face makeup I currently use a high percentage RETIN A cream for acne which obviously leads to dry skin patches in some parts I know this is normal with the medication but makes wearing makeup look not so smooth and makes the dry patches stand out even more I use some of this on my dry skin and massage it in for a minute and the patches are gone These dry patches are not just brushed off easily either THEY ARE STUBBORN I have tried applying makeup without using this seen the patches UGH removed makeup and used this and went to reapply and BOOM no more patches I am on my 7 tube and cant wear makeup unless using this before hand\\nread more Works AMAZING Went into the store to see if I could find a product to help with the clogged pores The woman shows me a bunch of products This being one I bought it and used it lastnight The before picture is right before I cleaned and used this the after picture is this morning My pimples have gone down a lot and have healed almost overnight Will definitely buy this again Love This was recommended to me by a Sephora employee due to having issues with exfoliating my t zone I have combination oilydry skin and sometimes its both in the same spot This peeling gel is gentle enough in my sensitive areas and strong enough for the tough to exfoliate areas like creases of my nose and around my eye brows Ive gone many days without make up because this product has changed the look and texture of my skin Would HIGHLY recommend Also good on rough elbows\\nread more First off I have super sensitive mediumtone skin that is both oily and dry depending on the time of year and temperatures In the fall and winter I get eczema on my face mostly at my temples and jaw line I will admit that with 7080 percent of products I try I end up breaking out on my skineven from SPF or the type of oil included For example I cannot use foundation with SPF and I even break out if I use Moroccan Oil hair products Keep this in mind because if you have eczema especially on your face Im going to continue as to why this is 5 stars I have tried almost all facial creams and have been prescribed antibiotics to clear my peeling skin for ten years each fall and I struggle to keep my makeup on for the full day because my skin gets so dry and flaky that I sometimes exfoliated multiple times a day just to prevent the embarrassing redness and dryness I NEVER would have paid this much for a producttried a product claiming without explanation to roll off dead skin without irritation given my reaction to most products However over Christmas I was staying at my place I rent out to a makeup artist in the Midwest and she told me to help myself to her products Within 2 days of exfoliating with this product and applying a VERY thin layer of my eczema topical cream before moisturizing with Tatcha Water Cream which I also tried for the first time because of my renter and my skin had not been this beautifully and clear with any other combination I have tried 89 different topical creams both steroid and nonsteroid and honestly I cannot even express how shocked I was that this product with Tatcha Water Cream made my skin look flawless AND FELT SOOOOO good The overall feeling of my skin when I move it after exfoliating and moisturizing is better than any SPA facial Ive spent hundreds on I encourage and recommend this product to anyone else who struggles with redness skin sensitivity dry skin and eczema as a face wash and solution\\nread more This product is a great mild exfoliant I like to use this before a hydrating mask or doing an extrahydration skincare routine one or two nights a week It is good for days when you dont use anotherstronger exfoliant but still want something to give your skin a boost the next day If youre looking for a refreshing look this a great peel that will give your skin a breath of fresh air It helps with fine lines and wrinkles along with Acne prone skin  Usually when I wear foundation or bb cc cream etc my skin especially around my nose and cheeks looks flaky I have tried all the exfoliants Enzyme ones physical ones everything But this is the only thing that actually fixes the problem Leaves skin smooth and clear not red and irritated Would highly recommend So gooooooood A Sephora rep told me to try this for my dry skin But first she said this is sooo disgusting She put some on my winter chapped skin and instantly my hand flaked ha Sooo gross but its soo awesome knowing your getting all those flakes of skin off your face in a non abrasive way Will also include in my skin care routine Love it I bought this on a whim after seeing it on the shelf and Im so happy I did I use it my brother uses it Ive gotten my friends to fall in love with it Definitely moisturize after use It makes such a visible difference immediately I will never use a physical exfoliant again This product is amazing I recommend it to all my friends and family WOW WOW WOW I get crazy bad flaky skin in winter and this saves my skin Nothing works like this Nothing Just rub it on for a little bit and you can see it take the dry skin off Afterwards my skin glows GLOWS Ive tried all sorts of exfoliators to get rid of dry skin but this is by far the best My skin is sensitive and I have zero reaction to this It is a holy grail skin product 1010 would recommend I used it every night for a few days and I quickly see the improvement Now I am obsessed with it I wish I knew about it earlier This product is great If you are working to move away from harsh drying agents this is the right product for you It works wonders This stuff really works My teenage daughter was having terrible hormonal breakouts and we tried something from the ordinary for acne which barely put a dent in it and I happen to love all the other ordinary products Ive used Once she started this we saw an almost immediate improvement This really clears up the skin This stuff is magic Put it on overnight and your blemishes will be gone or reduced by the morning Will buy again Results are honestly super noticeable in a day  This Product is great Application is easy as well nothing but positive results no irritation no odd smell  The formula has great strength yet it is very good for sensitive skin its really amazing how such small bottle can create big results Amazing Its no over night cure all but it definitely helps reduce blemishes Drastically Works well and clears acne quickly I would recommend this So ive had a cyst like blemish on my face for about 2 weeks Everything i tried would dry out the top of the skin but not shrink it So i saw this at Sephora and remembered i had seen a lot of great review so i decided to try it and within 2 days the blemish has decreased more than half its size Dont expect immediate results on the first try be patient it works This is much more affective than the Mario Badescu version I had a severe cystic breakouts recently and using this every night has definitely help soothe down the breakouts This is an amazing product and worth every dollar Lasted almost 4 months being used regularly by 2 people Put a thin layer on a spot overnight and it significantly reduces redness and size or even for 10 minutes before heading out 100 recommend I use this product one to two times a week It helps me get rid of inflamed acne Using a cotton swab I take some product and place it over my acne Do not shake the bottle It soothes and dries out the pimples very well Do not over use or else you will get dry patches from the alcohol I was hesitant to use this product at first because of the alcohol but it really does work This serum left my skin a lot softer and tight after using it consistently at night for a few days I love that I can apply moisturizer right after the serum because it sinks in right away theres no pilling or tackyness I did notice that my skin got a little more sensitive after about a week when I applied my sunscreen in the morning I will now be using it every other day because it seems to be making my skin better overall minus the sensitivity Recommend\\nread more Wasnt flakey cakey harsh or damaging to my skin in any way Finally a non

me love this serum Now my pocket hates you lol This serum is worth every penny The entire retinol line is worth it It really brings results with fine lines and wrinkles I can even see a slight change in my deeper wrinkles after 3 weeks This is my first review on Sephora because this product is worth EVERY Penny I am in my latetwenties normal skin and noticed some fine lines on my forehead nothing too crazy but it was something that started to bother me After using the serum for 1 week I already saw noticeable differences This is the first product to deliver results in such a short time Of

overall really great I used this product along with the night cream and eye creams together and they all were amazing\\nread more Very nice smooth application and soft feel Would buy again This is such a beautiful primer it just gives you that subtle glow and last all day this is the only primer i will ever use i have very sensitive skin so primers often clog my pores however this one gives my skin no troubles and applies beautifully it leaves a subtle but noticeable glow on my face and underneath makeup makes my face appear much brighter and healthier best primer ever I keep getting compliments on my skin and its ever since I started using this I have yet to find a primer like this one hydrates the skin and leaves it with an AMAZING glow under or on top of makeup LOV LOVE LOVE THIS MAC has a similar product but it doesnt hit the same Somedays you can skip foundation with this primer it gives a nice glow to your skin After years of trying different primers I always end up coming back to this one It adds a nice glow to the skin without any viable shimmer or glitter and does not clog my pores Only downside is if you use a lot it can pill and there seems to be a fragrance to it which can irritate sensitive skin I use this under the It Cosmetics CC cream and Urban Decay All Nighter and it works well with both Love this primer an employee recommended it to me and it gives me a surprisingly natural look to my makeup So far its definitely my go to This is a beautiful primer used under makeup or even just putting a layer on those no make up days adds just a beautiful glow for the skin Need to pick up another one I love this I have bought over and over again I was very surprised to see disappointing reviews Obviously no product is a miracle worker but this does provide a backlit effect under makeup just as it says Love it its really the best primer Gives you a healthy glow all day Doesnt leave your face feeling dry the formula feels great In love with this I have even gone ahead and worn this by itself for the subtle fresh nomakeup look I love this primer Its not heavy and it gives me a beautiful glow I have been using this for 4 days so far It goes on easy but has a sticky dewy feeling Initially the amount of glow scared me I put it on my face and I felt like I looked too shiny After applying my foundation and setting powder I became OBSESSED with this primer It really has the prettiest natural glow and became one of my favorite primers Also my make up stays on all day and looks great I will def be repurchasing I love this Bought the mini size because I could never bring myself to spend 40 dollars on something not skincare that goes under all the rest of my makeup This however is so gorgeous I find myself wearing it on its own this morning was a rushed morning and my night was spent with a man Ive been seeing off and on for 67 months and he walked me to my car and he just said to me wow youre gorgeous in no makeup even when you first wake up so yeah that pretty much solidified my thoughts of buying the fullsize haha what works best for me is letting my FAB mineral sunscreen moisturizer sit on my face for like ten or so minutes before applying anything else I actually follow that same rule with this primer as I have found if it is too wet and not absorbed at all youll lose that beautiful glow we all want this with any of the complexion rescue line by bare minerals is so beautiful hydrating glowy and comfortable and fast to work with I regret waiting so long to try it because this girl loves that glow that shimmer that radiance will repurchase and highly recommend it\\nread more Sit closer and look at my skin It looks amazing I am always weary of anything to put on my face My skin is wicked dry and everything feels cakey Not with this This makes me look like I have some inner glow and the confidence of Kim Kardashian It is light weight and not greasy in the least A wonderful purchase I suffer from cystic acne and this product does exactly what is necessary It helps clear up cystic and surface level blemishes I am currently using it with Drunk Elephants Retinol and the peeling and overturn of skin cells is helping my skin heal I would recommend using the smooth side of the pad if your skin is sensitive Ive been using tit twice a day for over a week and have already noticed a change\\nread more I absolutely love this product I have read other reviews and I will agree with some This product is astringent It will hurt if you have open active acne cysts just the same that rubbing alcohol will It was recommended to me by a Sephora employee to cut the pad in half to extend the shelf life I cut all 60 pads in half with sterile scissors after initially opening the jar I also pour a few teaspoons of rubbing alcohol in the bottom of the jar after initially opening the jar to prevent it from drying out It takes time for this product to work Using it twice a week and eventually every other day will clear up a lot of acne IF YOU STICK IT OUT AND USE A WHOLE JAR Dont expect results after 5 days Rome wasnt built in a day Plus using all 60 pads ensures that the acne flareup isnt due to natural bodily cycles Good luck\\nread more This product is amazing for my severe dry skin I tend to get flaky around my lines and this takes it off If you feel super dry after using this just use a thin layer of hydrating moisturizer Too much moisturizer will clog your pores I have been using this product for a while now Im on my 4th jar My skin is cleaner smoother and clearer I follow this with Good Genes and my skin and neck are looking fantastic I am 58 years old and look and feel great I am so glad I found Sunday Riley I have very acne prone skin and this is the only product that keeps my skin clear Honestly this is the only product that has cleared my skin up Ive tried a ton of things but after one night of using this my skin cleared to so much and I have bumps on my lower cheeks and it smoothed it all out my favorite product right now Best thing ever made i swear It has cleared up my skin to the point where I dont have to worry about breakouts I only worry when I have no more of this product left lol You wont regret it It has a strong smell reminds me of rubbing alcohol but it definitely does the job Amazing product a little bit drying though It got rid of all my hormonal acne and prevented more from coming out This product is nothing less than amazing I have had issues with bad breakouts on my jaw and cheek and have tried everything but nothing worked That was until I tried this amazing product Applied it before bed and could already see a big difference the next morning I have now used it for 5 days and my skin looks so much better Ordered these after I saw so many people raving about them and I love them too These are strong and will sting your skin especially if applying directly on acne The smell is strong too but not unpleasant Even after washing my face these pull out so much additional dirtoils because the pad always has something on it after I wipe This is my skins holy grail It helps me during my worst times Worth the price Worksvery well I combine tea tree oil these pads tretinoin hydroquinone and M61 hyrdoboost This addition to my beauty regimen has had a pronounced effect on my wrinkles FYIstress and hormones forced me to become a beauty expert These are incredible I wanted something to help combat acne around my neck and jawline but without having to put creams all over my face These are perfect Yes they are intense but I dont use them every day and I always apply a calming facial oil and good night cream afterwards Will definitely be reordering when I run out Didnt reduce risk of new acne but great for treating existing acne and helped to reduce scars I have cystic acne on my cheeks and chin that developed post partum I thought these were a great treatment for my form of acne Nondrying too If you are suffering from acne this has been a lifesaver It does cause a little dryness and flaking but nothing a good lotion cannot fix My 15 year old son uses these and its really helped his acne Obsessed You can honestly feel this product cleaning your skin My daughters moderatesevere acne has calmed down quite a bit since she started this product She is only 12 but most acne products sold at places like Target were not working Even Clinique was not working for her I thought Id give this a try before sending her to the dermatologist and it worked Now some nights she skips using this product and whamo New acne starts popping up all over You must use it faithfully if you have very oily acne prone skin like my daughter\\nread more Even though the scent can be a little overwhelming  cloyingly sweet yet pungent like drugstore acne pads  I swear by this product Its a great postcleanser silver bullet to prevent breakouts used as a substitute for my oil control toner The concentration is mild enough that I dont feel a burn and the pads are soft enough that they dont feel abrasive these pore strips are so cool i leave them on overnight and im both amazed and disgusted by the amount of oil on them in the morning but theyre so effective i wish they werent so expensive but i love that theyre different than traditional pore strips definitely love treating myself to a pack of these every few months Never written a review before but I feel like I have a duty to mankind to hype these I do not have acne I have never had acne But as I age lolIm 24 and I work out more I notice my pores are more visible and my dead skin builds up It took me a year and half to find a solution They pull all the gunk out of your skin and more The first time I wore one I realized that what I thought were air bubbles were just excess sht being sucked out by the hydrocolloid medium If you really want to gag peel off the strip once you hold it up to the light I went to get a hydrafacial after using these for a few weeks and the technician told me almost nothing came out of my skin She told me my skin was like butter Witchcraft or just a really good product You decide Pro tip sleep in these for maximum absorption\\nread more Guys these are amazing I was FULLY prepared to be disappointed in the results like ever other black head strip but these seriously surprised me After 3 hours I can already see stuff its pulled out of my pores I suffer with blackheads in my nose and chin area  Ive used everything  Literally  But these werent your regular nose strips that take 5 blackheads off and still make no difference  These strips suck everything out and keeping it longer on does do more work  So definitely would buy this package after I run out of the current ones  My teenage daughter has been suffering from moderate acne and Peace Out products have helped her tremendously She loves Peace Out Pores as they have larger sizes that help treat larger areas like her forehead nose and chin She loves that you can actually see that it is working by drawing out all the gunk in her blemishes These strips are my new fav They did as promised and pulled the gunk out of my clogged pores in a way that was very subtle and effective I also love how the strips are a nude color Practically perfect in every way My must and go to I highly recommend for those who get severe blackheads and or break outs I leave on over night and I can see results Leaves sticky feeling after however so I recommend washing your face after you remove the strip Ok so these are great BUT for me personally they did not remove anything from my pores What they did do was soften up all the crusty clogged pores Once I noticed this I went in with my black head remover tool and was able to clean out pores that had been clogged since I cant remember when Do they work Yes Will I buy them again Yes I honestly love this product and this company Everything they make is gold I have always fought with blackheads on my nose and with using these strips they are almost gone A must buy I love these pore strips They are tiny miracles These do exactly what it says theyll do which is pretty cool and gross to see Id recommend this product to anyone My daughter suffers from moderate acne and these strips are a godsend She loves how they suck all the gunk out of her acne and makes them flatter and less red We have tried other brands but nothing compares to Peace Out I live for these I recommend them to my students and my clients My nose and chin are prone to clogged pores Like if you look at them the wrong way they clog These strips keep my pores happy The strips dont dry out over night so it isnt all painful to take it off in the morning Theyre my go to to clear things up or if I feel a break out coming on Anything from PEACE OUT is amazing I use these once a week and theyre amazing I used to get the worst cystic acne on my chin and this has almost completely stopped it I swear by them I have been using these strips for a year They are the only product that clear my pores and help my acne These are by far the best pore strips Ive used I dont use them every night but when I do I wear it overnight Its oddly satisfying to look at when I remove it in the morning lol My husband loves using these too This product is the best quality pore strip Ive ever used  its strong yet gentle and does an amazing job keeping my blackheads at bay Love love love Wear them overnight and the next morning be ready to be a little bit disgusted but amazed Definitely recommend giving them a try This product is a game changer I totally swear by it I thought was just hype but I tried it 34 times and the result amazes me every time Work great Just wish there was an option to purchase a larger amount in one box I have sensitive skin and this does not cause any breakouts or irritation for me I have been using the Luna oil forever but with a move to a new city in a valley so all the pollution I noticed that I had congested bumps along my jaw line and nothing would get rid of it After getting one of those free facials with purchases over 75 in store the lovely employee recommended I combine the glycolic sephora pads every now and then with this serum And bumps are pretty much gone I was amazed Ive never seen these results so quickly Highly recommend\\nread more I

crateras u can imagine during the April 2019 Rouge sale I purchased the Peter Thomas Roth spot treatment I returned it after 2 weeks of use it did absolutely nothing I remembered how much I used to love this MURAD SERUM years ago and figured I had nothing to lose and it was on sale at half the price OMG I DO NOT KNOW WHY I ever stopped buying this it RADICALLY lightened up my post acne damaged

scars and not all over my face This is potent so I dont want to irritate my face by using it all over Instead by using it as a spot treatment for my acne scars it has done more in 1 week to lighten my freckles than most of my serums containing niacinamde do in two months The size of the scar literally is SHRINKING AND LIGHTENING This serum is magical I tell you I bought it for 45 when sephora was having a sale on it but I would rebuy it again at full price It is well worth the money in terms of its effectiveness\\nread more I just started using this about a week ago and I feel like my

it at night before bed I always wake up with a radiant glow When I have run out of it or forgot to use you definitely notice and see that my skin isnt as nice Although Ive tried other serums I seem to keep coming back to this one It reduces blemishes from any gnarly zits and helps even out uneven pigmentation like the gross sun spots Ive got from years of tanning abuse stay away from the subbed kids It even helps stop a zit in its tracks if I catch it soon enough Not at all greasy and while I mostly use it at night its light enough for day wear I have a scar on my chest that I recently got when my cat freaked out at the vet and Ive been rubbing some of the serum on the scar after I apply it to my face Its only been 3 weeks and the scar has faded significantly Im amazed at the results I have a few frecklessun spots on my face that have also started to fade and Im confident will fade even more with time I think my scar is fading faster because I am purposefully applying the serum to a specific spot vs my whole face Awesome serum worth the money\\nread more Amazing It visibly lower the pigmentation and make your skin look much healthier Also removes redness and make a tone even I

my skin was smoother and brighter After 2 weeks my skin is looking better than it ever has before The o let down side is it does make my skin dry around my nose a little other thank that its amazing Highly recommend its worth the price especially because its for morning and night so you dont have to buy 2 different serums\\nread more I love how this product makes my skin feel Plus it smells great I love this Vitamin C Serum Super lightweight sinks right in under my moisturizer  and OMG  lightened my spots and pigmentation and radiance is an understatement I am not sensitive to their blend of Vitamin C  its perfect Effective but gentle I love this serum it really does make my skin radiant one of the only face products that i actually keep buying again and again i have EXTREMELY dry skin and this is a HOLY GRAIL keeps my skin moisturized under my foundation all day just make sure its soaked into your skin well if not it will break up your foundation I love this stuff A little goes a long way Overall my skin feels more hydrated with it I can mix it with any other serums or my makeup and everything blends easier It really does give my skin a nice glow I havent noticed anything about a fine lines or wrinkles yet I havent been using it long enough for that Overall I really enjoy how hydrating this product is Makes my skin feels moisturized and smooth Love the gold flakes in it Great to use before foundation for makeup to just sit perfectly on face I use at bedtime when I feel like it as well Very versatile product Love this product Use it as my everyday face oil especially in the winter It is amazing This mask is amazing I love that you can use it 3 different ways My skin is always smooth supple and extremely clear after every use Best part is 5 mins is all you need Im a 23 yr old guy had acne for about 5 years tried masks from body shop but never worked Finally got this and it cured my skin Leviticus chapter 14 verse 5 in the bible also inspired me to get this Fresh Clay mask Read or google it and youll see what i mean Love Ive tried just about all of the trendy favs and this is the one I continue to buy Works great as a weekly mask By far one of my favourite masks Used it a few times on my whole face but mostly use as a spot treatment or just in my Tzone always great results Definitely worth the price Love it Great to use as spot treatment or full face mask Sometimes I used it just on the nose to clear blackheads and it works wonderfully as a weekly maintenance to rid of those pesky blackheads My daughter loves this product We got two samples from Sephora and she saw a difference on the first day and even more of a difference on the second It does exactly what its suppose to do It goes deep in to the pores and pulls the blackheads out The price is kind of steep but its worth itthats why I bought it I have 2 areas around my face w a lot of black heads acne scars etc the first time I used this mask all of those 2 areas completely cleared up make sure not to not be in clothes u care about while using this mask bc stains are hard to get rid of but other than that so far Ive loved this product This face mask helps to get rid of my pimples almost immediately after using it Its really good for reducing oil without drying out my skin The mask dries really quickly and comes off easily also works really well for spot treatments I have oily anceprone skin and this mask is amazing It feels really good on and leaves my skin super soft You can see it getting into the pores and clearing them My acne has improved significantly just using this a couple nights a week You also dont need to use a super thick amount of it so the large jar lasts a very long time OK I just tried this mask for the first time and WOW I decided to try it based off of reading the reviews I use to get the Rose face mask but wow I am so in love with this face mask already Definitely a must from this day forward I have SUPER sensitive skin I use this mask 12 times a week and it works magic on my breakouts and just deep cleaning my face I also use it as a spot treatment on my acne Highly recommend it I love using this as a mask because I have issues all over You really can see everything that it pulls out Its a great product I struggle with cystic acne and have tried everything including salicylic acid which made my skin worse This mask is incredible Ive only used it about 45 times and its gotten rid of my pimples and even helped with scaring Its worth the money Its also gentle on your skin Highly recommend I love this masks it reduces the appearance of my pores on my nose when I use it 34 times a week For example I used it today because the pores on my nose felt raised like bumpy and as soon as I used this mask after a 4 day hiatus of not using it the bumpiness feeling was gone when I washed it off made my skin feel nice and smoothsoft will use foreverrr So I Want To Start Off By Saying I Dont Usually Write Reviews On Anything I Buy From Sephora But This Product Is A Must Buy My Reason Is Because When I First Used This Mask I Notice That Everything That Was In My Pores Of My Nose Actually Came Out And I Was Shocked Many Times I Would Use Pores Strips To Try To Get Out Whatever In My Pores Of My Nose But This Product Is Truly Amazing I Will Truly Will Be Buying The Big Size Of This Also If You Have Big Pores Around Or On Your Nose Trust Me You Will See Everything That Was In It\\nread more Ive been using this mask for years and it is a lifesaver I love how versatile it is I can use it as a mask for spot treatment or even as a face wash It takes my problem areas and breakouts and makes them worlds better in just a matter of minutes One of the best purifying masks Ive ever used It along with some other skincare products helped me reduce whiteheads that had been bothering me for a while After trying many products that claim to reduce whiteheads but didnt work on me I went in to a store and asked a Sephora employee for any recommendations The first thing he recommended was this mask Then he also asked another associate if theres anything she would recommend The first thing she mentioned was also this mask So naturally I just had to give it a try And Im glad I did I could see results just after one or two tries Ill definitely repurchase\\nread more I have been using this product for well over three years and by far it is one of my favourite face masks I have ever used I use this after using the Umbrian clay facial scrub and they are phenomenal together The reason I really like this particular face mask is because not only does it make my skin feel softer and definitely refreshed but every time I use it I can visibly see the results of my skin looking better It looks smoother brighter and almost as though my skin has been airbrushed I have tried a couple of other pore purifying masks  both drugstore brands but also other brands that Sephora carries  and yes a lot of them also make my skin feel very similar BUT the visible appearance of my skin following is nothing compared to using this mask It is definitely worth a purchase and even though it is a bit pricey it might be best to try out the smaller size to see how it work for each individual I have tried those mask on a few of my friends that have problem skin because they have enlarged pores and get acne breakouts and they have had phenomenal results as well I think it is definitely worth the purchase if youre overwhelmed with multiple options It also had a light and refreshing natural scent when I use it it reminds me of having a great facial at a spa\\nread more Keeps my skin moisturized all day long I have dry skin especially during the winter and this has been a great base that keeps my skin healthy To be clear I am an overall fan of Sunday Riley I really like most products in this line and this oil is no different What I like most about Juno is it is an everyday oil Its an oil I can use on top of Retin A if my skin is feeling finicky at night or I can use it alone under foundation during the day It plays well with other product lines like Obagi NewDerm or as I stated can be used alone if I am trying to quickly get out the door or having an uncomplicated minimal product day Its a good oil to have on hand\\nread more This is my holy grail face oil Ive been using Juno for over a year and a half and I will never use another oil Makes my skin look and feel great  Ive never gotten so many compliments Im not even wearing foundation anymore my skin looks that good Try it if it works for you spend the  over and over I have extremely dry skin but break out real easily Ive been using Juno as a base moisturizer for about two years now and have no intentions of changing It can be greasy if too much is applied I use 3 drops per application 1 on my forehead and 1 in each cheek A little goes a long way If you could see all of my purchases you would know I have a bit of a beauty problem That being said this is my favorite oil hands down It has a light cranberry sort of scent and sinks in quickly A little goes a long way and it really soothes and brightens my skin I highly recommend for people who have combination skin because it doesnt dry me out doesnt cause breakouts and I dont walk around looking like a greaseball\\nread more Ive now purchased a second bottle of this product so I think I am familiar enough with the results to give an informed review I love the results that I got from this oil I felt that with extended use my skin was hydrated and glowy which is what I expected The scent isnt the best but I am okay with that because I prefer my skin care products to be nonfragranced Ive never found an oil that worked with my skin until Juno After the first use I woke up with soft clearer skin with less redness I was having a small breakout and it helped it immediately Totally recommend I have very dry skin and this oil helped me a lot Will definitely purchase it again I have quite dry sensitive skin and while this oil does sit on top of my skin a bit it also keeps my face from feeling like its going to crack I tried the Saint Jane Beauty serum around the same time as this Juno oil and found that they worked identically for my dry skin but Juno is half the price I have very dry skin thats is subject to hormonal break outs Ive used oils from Fresh Drunk Elephant and a few other high end brands This one is my favorite I originally purchased the 40 bottle but when it ran out I got the larger size I use it in the morning with Good Genes and Ice It absorbs well never sticky I rub it on my cuticles I slap it on my boys also If I am doing a mask such as mixing ceramic slip  good genes Charlotte Tilary Drunk Elephant Baby Facial or Glam Glow I use Juno afterwards and my skin is radiant This oil comes in very handy for me especially during the colder months\\nread more Its an early call but I think this is my favorite oil from Sunday Riley I have and use Luna and CEO when needed as well After just a few uses my face feels so soft and smooth This really gave my skincare routine a boost Im doing theatre and my skin gets really dry from having to scrub off the grease paint and the stage lights dont help This makes my skin feel so much better This is the best facial oil Ive used so far I use this morning and night I have dry skin and I use them after moisturizer 23 drops rub it in the palms of hands goes a long way This oil absorbs really well into my skin without feeling greasy i also use 2 drops in the AM it gives a healthy glow to my skin during the day The only thing I dont like is the smell it has a strong olive smell but it goes away after you apply it on Ive used DE marula oil it was also very moisturizing but I prefer Juno\\nread more Nice lightweight oil My tween can use this without breakouts  my skin feels naked without it I use this everyday My go to serum This product is less exciting than some as it doesnt have any noticeable smell and the texture is very liquidy not oil like or rich Long term use has resulted in clear bright even skin tone for me Seems to just help with everything  fine lines wrinkles acne even those under the skin pests I notice a decline in my skin condition when I stop using it so keep going back Highly recommend I tried a deluxe sample of this serum a few years ago and got so many compliments on my skin that I bought it full size and have restocked many times since It makes my skin bright hydrated and clear Its great for jade rolling too This serum is everything Im looking for Amazing with helping with uneven tone texture acne scars and dullness It absorbs quickly and is lightweight This bottle lasts a long time so definitely worth the price Whenever I sample another serum to maybe switch it up I always regret it and end up coming back to this one made my skin glow and all my friends family were commenting on how healthy and bright my skin looked 1210 recommended well worth the price I had been getting eczema flare up on my eyelids and extreme dryness from overuse of eyeshadow primers This product helped to reset my skin and get rid of the crepe dry and darkened look around my eyelids It changed my life as I dont need to apply hydrocortisone creams whenever I have irritation around my eyes Highly recommend this for anyone with eyelid eczema Use sparingly the product will last a long time and youll notice you can stop using it as frequently\\nread more I love this It smooths put my skin and seems to be a nice base for my moisturizer Been using only for two weeks and I love this product My skin looks more bright and well taken care of Doesnt give me any sensitivity Its just great and it is definitely worth the price Awesome product I can see a real difference in my skin Discolorations are gone gone gone This product is amazing I had a breakout last year and of course it left my face lots of dark purple scars from the acne I tried this one and can see the difference right after one use I have keep using it over few months and everyone around me can see the change clearly It works pretty well to brighten my skin and scars as well as keep my skin away from acne This product saves my life Be patient and keep using it you will see the difference\\nread more Absolutely LOVE this product My skin is left feeling so soft and has slowly reduced my acne scars on my cheeks It also doesnt leave your skin feeling sticky like some other products which to me is a sign that my skin is soaking it all up This serum doesnt have pleasant smell kinda like medicine but that doesnt bother me After the first week of using this serum i can see my acne scars are faded a bit my skin also smoother a bit from tiny acnes and blackheads too If you have conditions like me this serum is a good choice The important thing is if you use or not use this serum in the morning skincare routine always remember to put on suncreen otherwise you might get sunburn After all this serum has acid in it so becareful ladies\\nread more I keep coming back to this product because it works Its never irritated my skin and Ive seen fine wrinkle dissappear This is so great for lightening up dark spots I see an overnight difference every time I use it It also helps me with break outs which is amazing I cant speak to the fine lineswrinkles but I hope Im helping keep them at bay with this Im not even sure where to start I originally purchased the DDG set with 14 peels and a small bottle of this serum That set made me singlehandedly switch over nearly ALL of my skincare to DDG I am about a month and a week into using this serum both morning and night I have oily acne prone skin most of my breakouts are hormonal with very large pores You WILL NOT see immediate results As a matter of fact 2 weeks in I started purging and breaking out pretty bad I know retinol is not an ingredient used for the short termso I just kept using the serum I am SO GLAD I did Things have cleared up I wake up with smooth even skin I am not nearly as oily during the day plus bonus my forehead wrinkles are no longer noticeable I purchase the 2 oz bottle because it just makes sense when used day and night I urge you to try this product for a minimum of two months then assess your progress I plan to use this serum for the year Lightweight and absorbs quickly without residue An oily girls best friend\\nread more I love this product it left my skin beautifully soft and clear since day one the only thing I have noticed after a few days its a bit dry on some parts of my skin and I just cant use it everyday and it is expensive but overall I do like the nice change on my skin this product works immediately you dont have to wait weeks to see the results I love it Only been using for a week and has already drastically improved my skin more than anything else Ive tried Its expensive but for the results Ive had Id say its worth it I was asked if I found the fountain of youth This serum got rid of my ruddiness redness evened out my skin tone and smoothed out fine lines It brightens your skin and really makes it glow I never write reviews but this is worthy of a review Its magic sauce for my skin type Its so good that I need to write a good review on this product I used their red bottle serum as well This one gives huge help with my skin Skin tone gets even now so smooth And the little bump under the center of my lower lip its the most annoying place because my face is pretty smooth But I can always feel there little bumps like enlarge hair pore under there But its almost gone and getting smoother now I will highly recommend this product\\nread more This product truly gives your skin that youthful glow while evening out skin tone after a few uses Its super gentle for something that corrects uneven skin tones and great for sensitive skin The price may seem very high for this product but you really are paying for quality product and I normally dont buy over 200 serums but this one is amazing After keeping using it for 3 months I can see some changes and improvements It can not let your skin be whiter than your whitest part of the body But it can brighten your face gradually Very nice product but expensive I am in my late 20s and have nonsensitive combination skin I got this product to prevent the formation of dark spots I used Shiseido whitening line for years This product is more aggressive than Shiseido whitening serum which means you can see a huge difference within just one week It doesnt cause any irritation for me If you are concerned about ingredients this product may not be suitable for sensitive skin In addition this product might cause the feeling of dryness so that you should use cream or lotion after using it\\nread more I have been using the product for well over a year It really does work the sad truth that only expensive products work with the notable exception of Jack Black I have incredibly oily skin so I skip the serum in the summer and use only the Essence but I use this serum every day in the winter As soon as you apply it a slightly shiny sheen appears your skin actually glows a bit and without makeup my face does look a little oily but as soon as I apply my BB cream my face looks really good It certainly works but my suggestion is to apply it as needed based on your skin type\\nread more I have dry skin and after using the kvd foundation it became dull and more problematic no matter how much I exfoliated or tried to treat it I used the free sample I got and within 2 uses it restored my skins vitality and it made it velvety soft with a nonoily glow I knew SKII was good but I was skeptical of just the essence since I usually need heavy duty facial moisturizers but I didnt even put on the night cream and still woke up with beautiful supple and soft skin\\nread more Ive recently got into the kbeauty craze and this is my HG product I have had it in my likes for years and recently pulled the trigger to purchase All I have to say is WOW I have combination skin that is acne prone and prone to redness and has hyperpigmentation from acne scars Ever since I started using this it has evened my skin tone out so much and my skin has never looked so radiant It seems my skins tendency for redness is diminished too The price is steep but i dont even use a full dropper of product to cover my face and would expect the bottle to last at least 6 months I was confused and thought this was an essence but it is definitely a serum For all the kbeauty addicts I definitely suggest using a snail cream with it \\nread more I bought this just to try and was slightly skeptical but then I saw huge improvements in my skin in just a couple of uses I think the more concentrated pitera has something to do with it My skin became brighter less pigmented and blotchy This is a musthave for me now I would slather it all over if I could since it also smells wonderful I love this essence My face is brighter and smoother than it used to be all the people around me compliment me that my skin looks really good Definitely continue buying this one This is the most effective brightening product I have ever used I have tried a lot Even though it is expensive but try it You will see the difference Ive been using SKII Genoptics Aura Essence for four weeks now and my skin has

glowing I use this product at night before my nightly moisturizer It has a pleasant scent and absorbs quickly I also only use about a dime size amount so this product will last for months I havent even made a dent in it yet I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review\\nread more I cant speak for everyone but this serum works great on my sensitive dry skin Friendly advice

suffer from eczema around the sides of my nose but this serum helps keep it under control I use the FAB Hydrating Serum both in the morning and night to keep my skin hydrated and also to act as a

dry Ive always used moisturizing creams including some recommended to me by a dermatologist nurse but I would still be dry and peeling a bit while my chin became overly oily The sephora rep put this on my skin during a Perk minifacial and its been amazing No peeling and I dont feel oily at all I put it on after washing my face and then either put normal SPF moisturizer on top morning or my overnight cream night My skin has been amazing As noted the bottle lasts about a month which does make it a bit pricier than your normal OTC moisturizer but Im happy paying for amazing hydrated skin Recommended to my best friend and she had similar results We both dont spend a lot of makeup or face products but this is worth EVERY PENNY Recently ran out on a trip because my sister loves it and

brand that actually keeps my skin from drying out especially during the winter months I love love love this product I recommend it Sometimes though it can leave a tackiness to my skin thatll usually go away once I put my moisturizer over it I think the tackiness primarily comes from when I put too much product in one place so my skin doesnt absorb it all You dont really need the full pump unless you have a giant facewhich I dont I just halfawake put it onto my face and remember afterwards that I put WAY too much onto my face\\nread more When I first got this product I hated it but after it

again In the summer its the first thing I put on after washing my face followed by sunscreen and Im done with moisturizing This provides deep hydration without oiliness and has calmed down my easily irritated skin It goes on smoothly isnt sticky and smells good The price tag has been worth it for me In the winter I use this as my first layer as well but also put a moisturizer before sunscreen

Its super clean and manages to baby your skin while still being effective\\nread more slowly but surely tatcha products have taken over most of my routine in no specific orderI use the rice polish

yr of trying different products and finally  a game changer\\nread more Much better than the Clinique hydrating mist A little pricey but can be used throughout the day I prefer the weight and

using this product and Ive noticed a huge difference in my skin I would highly recommend I get it it is very expensive but it does works Sadly for me im not using as much make up as I used to so I been using this alone as a sun screen it doesnt make my fave greasy One thing do I noticed the product is getting murky but still works I used this every day I love how it blurs out stuff like fine lines and makes my skin appear smoother Also bonus is spf first of all i would like to say that ive never looked so young after using this once applied it looks like i have 0 pores and my face is completely matte i did see bad reviews on this product peeling BUT if you continue to rub it in it lays on the skin perfectly i have to rub for about 30 seconds for the peeling to stop trust me it looks amazing after you actually rub it in ill never try another primer again Non greasy blurs and doesnt clog pores and acts as a great primer Holy grail AMAZING I used this sunscreen alone with no make up It made my face look like I had spent hours putting on make up and my skin looked flawless I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants a primer and sunscreen in one Love the velvet feel Just glides on A little amount goes a long way and I dont have to worry about sunscreen I have super sensitive eczema skin and this produce does not irritate my skin This is the best most luxurious SPF ever It doesnt smell sting your eyes or leave any white film plus it doubles as a primer I hate wearing SPF but this product make it a treat Love love love buy it its my all in one skin perfecter it blurs my skin and leaves me looking poreless the days i dont wear makeup my skin looks smooth the days i wear makeup it doesnt move crack crease anything love the invisible spf too no flashback must have I use this as a primer for my makeup I love it It has a sunscreen SPF 30 It goes on so easily It looks good even without makeup Add a little powder and then great look Makes my pores look smaller Does just what it says It blurs your imperfections I love this It works just like it says it does for my skin Just purchased my second bottle I absolutely love this sunscreen I will never use anything else and I have tried them all I love that it doesnt leave me looking like a white ghost It goes on super smooth and a little goes a long way It lasts for a looooong time I still reapply midday but I can tell its still on from the morning I know the price seems a little high but one bottle lasts me 67 and sometimes 8 months I dont skimp when it comes to sunscreen so this is a huge moneysaver for me I saw a few others that said this wasnt going on smooth that happens at the start of every bottle but only for the first several uses I just use a little extra and keep smoothing until it blends Also Ive found that some cleansers can cause this to ball up as well I ditched those cleansers and havent had a problem since The icing on the cake this makes your pores just disappear and really helps to make your skin tone look lovely Ive been able to cut back on makeup and just use this compliments all the time\\nread more Been using this serum for 6 years Simple ingredients Easy to use I apply this all over the face and chest It helps keep my skin clear from breakouts from workouts Love it Works great Keep finding myself coming back to this retinol serum Leaves your skin feeling refreshed helps with targeting uneven texture This product is just awesome Ive been using another Retinol brand which was more expensive than this one and gave me fairly good results This one is different It gets absorbed right away and never leaves a greasy layer its really as if Im watering my face It instantly feels supple  hydrated with zero irritation and no tons of dead skin on my face in the morning Ive been only using it for 2 weeks but I can tell my face is getting more radiant  hydrated than ever Cant wait to see the results a few months from now Highly recommended \\nread more So far 3 weeks definitely seeing good results And have experienced no irritation or peeling even though my skin profile is dry Love this I have fair skin with lots of what I thought were frecklesbut really they only come out in the summerand then kind of hang around albeit a little lightened This product drastically removed those freckles and now I realize thats just sub damage So I make sure to put on lots of sunblock and what a difference Ive only been using it every night for the last two weeks and its amazing No irritation or anything Im 39 and my 72 year old neighbor told me about this and shes got perfect skin\\nread more This is great Ive always struggled with extreme dryness with regular clinical retinol but this helped clear my skin and while it dried my skin it wasnt an uncomfortable dryness It is a holy grail I use it 23x a week and it is a holy grail Definitely worth a try I used to use a prescription retinol but switched over to this a few months ago just for the convenience of picking it up in store I love it The product works it is not heavy on the skin It absorbs right away with no greasy feeling and my skin looks refreshed when I wake up in the morning The best Ive consistently used this for about a month now and I can say with 100 confidence this product is amazing My skin feels much firmer and my freckles are lighter This product isnt irritating or drying at all Make sure you give it time to work because retinol doesnt give immediate results Also make sure to use enough since its watery its easy to not use enough I think Love it so much Best retinol ever At first I didnt think I was going to like this product Second I didnt understand the hype over retinol I decided to splurge and give this product a shot and Im so happy I didThis is my second bottle and my first one lasted me over a year so I think you really get your moneys worth with the amount that you get You dont need a lot just 45 drops was enough but oh boy is it powerful I noticed that my skin started clearing and became brighter I would even say it brought a youthful glow to my skin Ive recommended this product to a lot of my friends and they all agree that it has changed their skin for the better\\nread more I started using this a month ago I am 48 have fair skin fine lines and skin starting to look a little loose This has changed my skin for the better I notice fewer lines and my skin looks clear smoother and tighter I use this nightly  3 drops then let it dry and dab on some light lotion or aqua bomb on top just to seal it in overnight It really has helped First night used it no issues Went in easy  no detectable smell I skipped the second night because my skin slightly started flaking Then I used it two nights in a row My boyfriend who has no idea what goes into my skincare regime or that I was trying something new actually commented out if the blue on how supple my skin looked What Ok Sold  LOVE My sensitive skin loves this serum and its really helped with fine lines and moisture  Absolutely in love with this product Ok so I was looking for a Retinol product that would help with very little thin fine lines under the eyes and to even out my skin tone This stuff is IT I found what I was looking for The bottle it comes in is very easy to use I take the dropper and just put a few drops on my face and rub it all over with my hands I have normal to dry skin and I use this every night and just wash my face in the morning It hasnt broken me out or irritated my skin I was amazed at how fast this stuff works I kid you not that I saw results after ONE time of using it It gave me smooth soft and hydrated skin My face looked amazing Now I dont suffer from acne never have so I cant comment on whether it helps that It does help the fine lines and if you have uneven skin tone it helps so much If you have any little rough spots on your face this stuff smooths it out A LOT I cant say enough about this product

the holy grail Cleared up my recurring adult hormonal acne within one week Ive been using only in the AM as the first step in my skincare routine This will be a staple in my routine go forward My daughter had acne on her forehead and temples occasionally her cheeks No other OTC treatment works like this stuff She almost never has a single spot if she uses this every night When we ran out and Sephora was out of stock her acne came back with a vengeance We finally got our bottle about a week ago and her skin is already clearing up with no new spots This is our holy grail to get her through the skin struggles of puberty\\nread more It actually works I use it at night only otherwise it is too drying It is still pretty drying even using every night but it cleared up my small little forehead zits really well I gave this product 5 stars because it works very well at clearing up acne A word of warning use sparingly It is very strong and I would suggest using it in affected areas because it will dry out skin in areas that dont have acne This is not your everyday all over face lotion I received a sample of this and after the first use noticed its effectiveness Will be purchasing This is the best product Ive found that works for my skin Im afraid it will go extinct because I can go for periods being unable to catch it in stock KS products are solid not trendy They work so well Happy to see it was back in stock after a long hiatus on Sephora I know that my skin usually responds well to Benzoyl Peroxide products but Ive been having a prolonged chin breakout for almost three months My usual favorites Neutrogena Clear Pore CleanserMask and Paulas Choice Extra Strength Daily Skin Clearing Treatment hadnt been able to keep up My skin was becoming irritated and much more likely to flakepeel then it ever had Enter Kate Somerville The product has excellent slip I feel like its effective with minimal application and it delivers the results of Benzoyl Peroxide with actual hydration and virtually no irritation I applied it only to my problem areas for about five days and the appearance change was dramatic I still had a few small clogs along my jaw line but nothing like I had been dealing with Since then Ive treated my forming zits by double cleansing applying blue light therapy and finishing with a tiny dab of Anti Bac And in conjunction with finding good lightweight moisturizers Ive kept all but the really hormonal acne at bay for months Super love it Usage notes only to apply to affected areas spot treating if possible Remember to use sunscreen as this can sensitize skin slightly Also I probably wouldnt use if I didnt have results from benzoyl peroxide in the past\\nread more Best acne lotion ever  The only one that can help me with my cystic acne Love it I have combo to oily skin with occasional breakoutshormonal acne This stuff is the best It controls my skin like no other I know the price is a bit steep but its worth every penny to me I apply a thin layer every night after my cleanser and toner Will keep coming back for this product over and over again SO impressed w this stuff I dont have acne but I have blackheads on my nose It definitely clears them up Word of caution I cant use daily because itll make my skin break out But every other day seems to do the trick Just listen to your skin But srsly get this if youre having issues w blackheads I dont normally write reviews but holy cow you guys This stuff is amazing I have oilyacne pronesensitive skin and it doesnt irritate my skin at all and actually helps regulate my oil production as well It doesnt overly dry my face either which is a huge plus Im so sad that its out of stock literally everywhere right now because my face is crying a little bitBUT it is 100 worth the purchase I use 11 12 pumps for my whole face and down under my chin as well even though I dont have any acne down there This stuff is a miracle\\nread more I love this product Worth the price I get inflammatory acne on my forehead from autoimmune dysfunction After one week of using this lotion twice daily all of the bumps on my forehead cleared And when I had an autoimmune flare up it prevented another breakout I have been searching for so long for a solution to my break outs It did not dry my skin out either even when applying 3 times a day The Anti Bac Clearing Lotion has been a huge confidence booster\\nread more My dermatologist recently retired so I purchased this to quickly replace a prescription benzyl peroxide gel I had a large zit on my cheek as I started to use this I remembered reading a review mentioning a purging phase as my one zit turned into 8 on the same cheek I toughed it out for 3 weeks before seeing a decrease in white heads and cysts The black heads on my nose were easily tamed in one week After showering I wet a corner of my towel with HOT water and press it on any painful zits I think this helps soften my skin and allows for better absorption\\nread more Ive repurchased this gem multiple time along with a few other products that have left my skin almost poreless and so smooth with minimal acne My forehead used to look like the Rocky mountains and as it cleared up Ive experienced less and less break outs This product combined with others is my holy grail My favorite bp product This lotion helps cleared out my mild facial acne Initially I did have a minor purge but after a week I started to notice improvement It had been a month of using this and I have the best skin of my life yet 70 clearer Although it helps prevent new pimples from popping up the lotion wont help cure present acne though This is the first product that cleared up hormonal chin acne after 6 months of salicylic acid glycolic retina niacinamide and clindamycin I just wish I had used it before my wedding Thank you Kate Somerville This lotion is fantastic I started seeing reduced breakouts on my chin within two weeks Not too drying even with two applications per day which is important in an acne medication A new everyday product I have oilycombo skin that is prone to breakouts once a month or when I accidentally sleep with my makeup on oops When I do find that my skin is breaking out I use this lotion before my moisturizer in the morning and find that it helps clear my skin faster than just waiting for my breakouts to subside on their own It works great under all my skincare and makeup products and is easy to use before my morning makeup routine It will dry out your skin if you use it daily for a few days but just make sure to keep your skin hydrated throughout the day to avoid flaky skin Overall I recommend this as a solution to help clear pesky breakouts in a shorter time span It is easy to use and works great with other skin and makeup products so theres no worrying about products piling or this products effectiveness\\nread more I go through a lot of acne related products due to my body and this stuff really helps reduce my problems and sometimes clears it up completely It can be very drying but to combat that I put on a moisturizer after applying this product prior my makeup or night routine Honestly its really worth a try if Benzoyl Peroxide usually works for you Ive enjoyed the results so much that Im putting it as a current staple in my regiment Also that pump design is a HUGE win in my book\\nread more I have BAD hormonal acne and this cleared it up in just days Overnight after the first use I could already see a lot less redness and my acne had visibly become less swollen I use Biossance Squalane  Vitamin C oil underneath to combat the drying from the benzoyl peroxide and top it with Farmacys facial moisturizer My skin is GLOWING in the two weeks Ive been using this routine Will absolutely use this for life now\\nread more Im always hesitant to drop money on acne products because my skin is so sensitive I get pretty moderate hormonal cystic acne on my jawline and this is the only product controlling and keeping it away It is strong and drying but doesnt feel like its stripping my face so I do use an oil free moisturizer on top of this I have tried so many products and I swear by this I also never leave reviews but this needs to be said for the ladies struggling like I did My routine is YTTP superfood cleanser this and then cetaphil oil free PM moisturizer and I havent seen a cystic acne spot in over three months\\nread more I absolutely love this serum It is one of the most hydrating products Ive ever used And its not just surface hydration  it hydrates on a deeper level I love this for the cold winter months and whenever I need an extra boost of moisture I will continue to purchase this product I have use Josie Marans Argan Milk for several years now As someone with more mature skin I have transitioned from oily skin to drier skin and this product works wonders at giving me a dewy glow without lookin greasy and leaves my skin feeling hydrated Highly recommend for anyone with a drier complexion Ive been using this product for about a year now I noticed a big improvement after the first application My skin looks fresher more youthful and firmer The longer I use it the better my skin looks Must buy for dry winter skin My skin went from being so dry that all fine lines were visible to being hydrated and plump in under two weeks I love this product for winter Works great Very hydrating Would re purchase Was suggested by Sephora employee I was shocked by the antiaging of this product This is my favorite Josie product and feels lighter and less heavy than her original oils My favorite use for this is for under the eye If you have tried everything for under eye hydration this is the thing you are missing I love Josie Maran products and the pure argan milk is wonderful I use it when I have dry areas on my face or acne and areas of irritation I also dab it around my eyes to help with fine lines I notice a huge difference when I use this product and highly recommend it Just use it sparingly since a tiny bit goes a very long way The best Ive tried so many products and absolutely love argan milk I purchased this in hopes that it would help my skin out I wasnt sure what was going on with my skin It was so dull I can say I literally looked dehydrated Applied this at night and the next morning MY GOD My face looked 100 times better I was really amazed My face felt plumped and soft and my skin tone was even I WILL be buying this again This product literally changed my skin in one use and I accidentally figured it out I have combination skin and a VERY oily nose and chin I was going to avoid those areas but just did it anyway and to my surprise my nose and chin have been not oily at all and my skin feels like a baby Who knew Ill be purchasing the full size Im guessing this is better for combooily skin and thats why its suspended in water I dont know but it changed my life None of my skin is extremely dry just for reference\\nread more I understand why some people are leaving negative reviews about the price but this is honestly one of the best oilsmoisturizers Ive ever used I have oilyacne prone skin and I can for sure tell a difference when I use this I ran out of my recent bottle and decided to take a break from it for wallet purposes and my skin within a week started to miss it I dont know whats in this but whatever it is it works for me The price is high but for something that is clean and actually works I feel that its justified Ive repurchased this a handful of times and dont plan on stopping\\nread more This Argan milk has literally changed my skin I swear by this stuff Ive told everyone I know about it ans after using it for two months Ive noticed my skin is completely gorgeous Even people around me have noticed My lines are barely visible on my forehead I am in love Please go out and try this for at least a month Josie Maran has found liquid gold This was a gift to someone who was furloughed to keep their spirit up through a tough time How did I not use this before I use it Morning and night and what a difference I even think it makes my pores smaller I live in a very dry climate so this just adds so much moisture but not to where Im oily looking It sinks right in The dropper does suck like the rest of the comments say but the product is so great I dont care I love this mask I have a lot of cystic acne as well as other kinds of acne and this mask helps decrease the bumps and gets rid of my acne faster I also think it declogs my pores because I have noticed some gunk come out of my pore after use not RIGHT after but maybe a day or two which is A LOT better than that clogged pore turning into a pimple I used GlamGlow charcoal mud mask before this one and I think this one works a lot better I use it on my whole face or spot treatment The instructions say to use 34 days a week but I wish I could use it every day I havent tried because I dont know if it would be bad to use it every day\\nread more I hardly leave reviews but this stuff is seriously amazing Ive struggled on and off with acne since I was a teenager and this is now a must have in my arsenal Im quite oily and this helps to get that under control Its expensive but it lasts a long time Worth it though Great for very sensitive skin Notice it was working first time I used it I have cystic acne on my chin and since using this line it has not came back and has cleared up Now on to fighting the scars that I previously had prior to using this line Great spot treatment for cystic acne The smell is strong so I wouldnt recommend use for all over the face I like to use this and then do my face wash after to ensure the smell is gone I saw a drastic difference in my acne size overnight i just received this a day early actually I have really bad bad acne and its been going on for 2 plus years Im 21 and i have tried everything The smell isnt as strong as people say very soothing and i think it smells great Ill post after pics after a couple weeks I hope this helps I have very very acne prone skin I struggle with cystichormonal acne and i felt like no product I tried even made much of a difference until I started using this I use it every other night and I wake up and the size of the pimples has gone down significantly Theyre less red and the infected whiteheads are nearly always gone It doesnt completely clear me up but it makes it so much easier to bare and the remaining bits can be fought with the rest of my routine I could not recommend this product enough to my fellow acne prone pals\\nread more This is the best acne mask Ive ever used Just a warning the way it works is when you use it it pulls everything up to the surface So you might wake up with more acne that you started BUT I use it again the night after and my face looks great Using it two nights in a row really seems to work for me  Im obsessed with this mask Just be sure to use it a couple days before a big event not the night before  I love this mask A small amount really covers your whole face My skin feels refreshed after applying it and it has helped clear up my hormonal breakouts Contrary to other reviews I dont think this mask has a strong sulfur smell and Im very sensitive to the smell of sulfur I used to have cystic acne on my jawline I purchased it on Sep 4 and during this month I only had one tiny acne BTW its spot brightener is really working This mask ended my acne breakout that I have been dealing for a year This is a must have for those suffering from acne This truly works I have been using it every other day for 10 minutes and it never dried my face Of course to prevent drying of the skin I use caudalie vinopure serum sulwhasoo moisturizer and Sulwhasoo sleeping mask every night My sister who was also dealing with acne bought this immediately when she saw the improvement in my face and she was so thankful for it She uses it everyday and it never dried her face but she is also doing what Im doing I have no new pimple even when its that time of the month Will keep on buying this\\nread more My skin has been breaking out for about a month and my usual skin care routine was not helping I tried 1 or 2 different masks and saw no results so I decided to buy this mask because the reviews were so good Best purchase Ive made in a while Ive only used it once last night and I woke up this morning with significantly less acne than I had yesterday I have numerous bumps on my face and they have been reduced to two very small ones The area where my acne was was also pretty enflamed and red and its completely back to normal I dont even understand how a mask can work this well and I dont know why I didnt hear about it sooner\\nread more I love this mask And its a pretty good bang for its buck compared to other masks Yes its 55 BUT a little goes a long way and with only using it twice a week itll last me at least 46 months Im sure It really seems to help with my cystic acne and my face feels amazing after I use it It doesnt dry it out either I LOVE ITT can see a difference after a couple uses doesnt dry my skin out too much but take cares of active pimples Have tried everything known to man Randomly had a breakout of cystic acne near my mouth that didnt seem to go away no matter what mask cleanser etc I used I heard the hype about this product but was hesitant because of the price Tried a sample and the next day all my bumps was gone and I am amazed Best product I have nice skin so I have never felt the need to purchase a serum I typically just use ones I get as part of a sample reward or gift set I got this as part of a PTR gift set Loved it but didnt plan to purchase After a few weeks without it I KNEW I needed to buy it I actually missed it as part of my skin routine and it truly makes the skin SO hydrated and smooth I have yet to try another serum that comes close to replacing this\\nread more A little over a year ago my skin became incredibly dry for the first time in my life I did a little research and read about hyaluronic acid I decided on this serum because of its high percentage of HA This absolutely changed my skin Not right awayI dont think any serum truly works instantly But using this along with Freshs rose toner made such a difference Just bought another bottle of this since my skin is drying out a bit due to it being winter\\nread more Only hydrating serum I ever reach for ingredient wise nothing tops it so Im trying to push it to 5 stars cause it deserves it Really like it Moisturizing Goes on Easily Have been using it for monthsI think it makes a difference Had bought in Costco in summer but tried in heating season This serum has a very competent set of ingredients In addition to hyaluronic acid it contains a large number of moisturizing components that help to moisturize the skin and not to draw the last moisture out of your skin There are Sodium PCA honey algae silk I compare this serum with ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Water Essence which contains 8 different forms of hyaluronic acid Peter Thomas Roth serum works much better I used this serum with the selftitled cream Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream and my skin was very smoth soft and hydrated as a skin of baby and no dryness in the area around the mouth\\nread more Awesome Awesome product I have dry skin and this is very moisturizing I absolutely love this I live in whistler and the air is really drying an its the only thing that saves my skin I tried the sample first as it came in a set and didnt think I would use it as much honestly but the set had a full size moisturizer and few things to try for a great price This serum not only helped me with my acne scars but also hydrates my skin I never used a serum before but this is a must must must have Amazing product works great with the cleanser and moisturizer as well I strayed away from this product for a while and i REGRETTED IT my skin is combo borderline dry and Sensitive plus I use a image retinol mask once a week that leaves my skin drier than normal this doesnt disturb my skin and it brings moisture to the areas that require it I am in love with this serum it is worth every penny I have noticed an improvement in my skin with smaller pores and it is just overall tighter I have not had a single random breakout just the usual hormonal pimple or two around that time of the month I apply first thing when I get out of the shower in the AM and then I use a tinted moisturizer instead of foundation and go about the rest of my make up I also apply in the PM after I wash my face then I follow it with the Laniege Water Mask to lock in the moisture LOVE\\nread more This serum is great I have dry skin and Im prone to allergic reaction especially any serum that contains vitamin c this makes my moisturizer just glide on and keeps me hydrated throughout my sometimes 9 12 hour work days and sometimes even a few hours after work and added bonus it didnt give me any kind of allergic reaction or itch as many serums have Made a huge difference in my skin I already use the cloud cream from the same line and this visibly improved the texture of my skin I have combination sensitive skin and this didnt cause irritation First time mom here I think that statement explains itself not that I need to be first time Im tired Im a walking zombie and I live on coffee to get me through the day All was fine while I was on maternity leave and getting up whenever worked for us but now Im up at 5am after going to bed between 10 and 12 and having 12 feedings during the night which usually have me up for almost an hour Well I decided to up my beauty routine and started with a combination of this and the moisturizer used before I go to bed I have other IS Clinical products I use in the morning to treat my Rosacea and Eczema WELL to my surprise today I was given a compliment about how rested I look given the new baby at home Cant believe it and to top it off the compliment was given by someone who never dishes out nice comments only points out when you look like youve been hit by a train Ive been using this for a couple weeks now and couldnt be happier Worth every penny\\nread more Love I have super dry skin and this has been a game changer I noticed results right away Lightweight easy coverage dries pretty fast A little pricey but personally Ill pay when something actually works It is an excellent product I really love this product The only downside is that I seem to run through it quickly since I have very dry and dehydrated skin I would love it if came in a larger value size Very light and sinks in but does leave the skin feeling plump and a touch dewy Great in the morning too because it does not ball or pill up under makeup like other products do My favorite use is after cleansing and toning and before my treatment serums oils and moisturizer\\nread more Been using my moms bottle for a couple weeks now to try it out purchased full bottle during VIB sale Doesnt break me out I was using the Hada Labo Premium serum for a while and after removing it from routine my acne has become a lot better But I need to add another hyaluronic serum my skin feels dry without it This helps keep my skin feel comfortable throughout the day Its pricey but it doesnt make me break out I spritz La RochePosay thermal water spray prior to application I use it in the evening and the cloud moisturizer in the morning I spritz La RochePosay thermal water prior to both applications I layer a night cream after application of this serum and another serum I may try something different thats more cost friendly in the future once I figure out what works with my skin In the meantime my skin needs to be drenched without the breakouts\\nread more Its expensive but dare I say extremely worth the price I will continue to purchase this product Ive been adding this to my moisturizer for about a month now and I can definitely tell the difference My skin is no longer thirsty by noon 1010 would recommend to my dry skin sisters I have struggled with dry skin all my life and have tried most hyaluronic serums in the market but none had worked for me This is the first product that really makes a difference in my aging dry skin Ive used it directly on my clean face before night moisturizer It makes my face baby soft the next morning Ive also mixed it with my long wear foundation and it helps to keep it a little more hydrated The routine that really works for me now is as follows DHL face oil for cleaning Clinique moisture surge lotion as toner Dennis Gross hyaluronic marine hydration booster Clinique Vitamin C serum Biossance or FAB moisturizer and Biossance squalene face oil The texture of this serum is watery so I applied one drop onto one section of my face at a time Personally I think this is probably the best serum in the market for addressing issues related to dryness\\nread more A product that works Light weight no smell hydrating best way to prep skin before makeup Ive ever used My dry skin loves this product and my makeup application has never been easier New holy grail The only downside is the price tag Honestly Im SO THANKFUL to have found this product I struggle to keep my sensitive and rosaceaprone skin even hydrated calm and clear I especially struggle with moisture and calmness because I use Differin and occasional BHA Paulas Choice to keep inflammation and acne at bay which can leave my skin dry and a bit irritated This serum INSTANTLY hydrated and calmed my skin It just feltcomfortable and looked even and balanced Highly recommend if you have sensitive and dry skin\\nread more I use it as a serum and it is amazing Absorbs quickly into my skin and keeps it hydrated all day Also makes my skin look plump and glowing Love this stuff I have very very sensitive skin and I havent had any issues with this THIS this is the hydrating first layer that you need to give you dewy skin all day long This plus a ceramide emulsion plus sunscreen is your recipe for the best skin of your life Slight fragrance but didnt cause any irritation for me I know its pricey but it goes a long way and it does its job so well This is great product I have combination skin that gets dryer in the colder months and this makes my skin feel so soft and rejuvenated I wear it every night before bed and in the morning before I put my makeup on for the day you do not need a lot though or else it will make your skin too oily I finally figured out the perfect amount to use which is 2 drops in my problem areas I highly recommend this product\\nread more Noticed a big difference in hydration and skin clarity almost immediately Hi Im not a review writing type person but this product deserves it It is seriously the only thing that calms and soothe my flaming red rosacea My cheeks occasionally get super hot and red not numbs just fire engine burning red Ive used this for atleast 6 months now and I cant say enough about it The best part is it calms immediately and gets even better with recurrent use My complexion is back to normal within 24 hrs\\nread more You should know that this product left my skin super sticky BUT I use it after the Dr Gross 2 step peel and its PEERRRRFF for that I do it before bed so I dont care that its sticky and it gives me awesome dewy plump skin I wouldnt want to put makeup over it or anything else but for this specific function it is an awesome product Shaleesa from bramalea sephora used it on my skin during my skinfit facial my skin has not looked better beforeive been one of the dry skin girls whose makeup neverr lasted regardless of what primersetting spray i use this smooths my skin like no other My dry skin loves this My skin just feels more supple and hydrated when i use this Ive started using the Ordinary brand hyaluronic serum and its not as good as this but its 16th the price When all the steps in your skin care routine are expensive the ordinary is good to switch off with Although when i run out of that i will be splurging on this again The product is slightly tacky and I would prefer more Hyaluronic acid and less of the other ingredients But Im on my 2nd bottle because it provides the right amount of moisturizer for my combination skin in both warm and cold weather If I need more moisture I apply a second layer The bottle and dropper are perfect for controlling the amount dispensed and keeps the product sanitary I switched to this from Peter Thomas Roths Hyaluronic serum because it came in a pump bottle and wasted so much product that it barely lasted 3 weeks One bottle of this booster lasts about 3 months\\nread more I got a microdermabrasion facial about a month ago and the esthetician recommended this product After a months use I can completely see a difference in my skin Clearer smoother and more subtle Smells amazing too Definitely recommend This product is the best I use it twice a day Its very light weight water based so it layers well with whatever else you might use The woman who does my facials asked what I started doing differently bc she noticed such a change in my skin for the better and said shes going to buy it too I bought this for my fiance because he has rosacea and it gets worse during the winter He tried many different moisturizers that worked well enough but still left his skin flaky This serum helped his skin and now his skin is much less flaky The stars are his rating  this serum is anazingggg I used to feel like serums made my face more oily which I did not like because I am pretty oily already but not the case with this serum I noticed my skin was brighter after the first use and by the 4th day I was in awe at the difference I have tried lots of different primers and setting sprays for oil control This is the only primer that actually works for me I usually apply makeup around 430 am and by maybe 100 pm at the latest Im oily But this primer has been on since 430 am and its now 4 pm and Im still pretty much shine free I have a very minimal amount of shine right now nothing compared to the amount of shine I normally have When I applied this primer I could instantly feel the matte effect I absolutely love it\\nread more This primer truly minimizes pores I absolutely love it Love this primer  its the best  It does dry off white but once u put on your foundation u cant even tell Best mattifying primer hands down For all the people who horrifically in their used used milk of magnesia because all the other primers were playing around this means business Only use this if your skin is truly the real deal type of oily skin This will keep you matte essentially forever P I swear by this primer No matter what foundation I used no matter how matte it was my Tzone would be shiny and oily by the end of the day I apply this primer to my tzone before I put on my foundation and my makeup stays matte all day It literally only takes a pea sized amount just applied to your problem areas so a bottle lasts a long time Definitely worth the price I have very oily skin and this is the only primer Ive found that works for me This is soooo matifying However I feel like it keeps my makeup from going on smoothly at times because it makes my skin so dry I normally use a regular primer to smooth out my skin then pat this on my t zone The combo of the two seems to make my foundation less cakey This also works really well for me without make up to control shine throughout the day Overall I would really recommend this if you have oily skin combination skin probably would benefit from a different product\\nread more Love it If youre not oily this isnt for you  If you are stop all other primer use and get matte Not pretend matte for a few minutes but all day  I was all about smash box and Im Sticking with this This is the only primer I will use It goes on so smoothly and really gives your face a nice base for the rest of your makeup One bottletube lasts a really long time even using it every day I originally received a small sample a few yrs ago but I am on my 3rd tube now Definitely a musthave I use this in my T zone and it just makes my makeup look so smooth and matte I physically saw my pores blur and disappear when I put it on Which is exactly what I wanted because I get oily so easy if I use liquid makeup I love this This stuff is amazing It keeps the oil and shine away all day WOW How have I not used this primer sooner It is like using Giorgio Armanis Luminous Silk without any pigment The texture is smooth and not gritty and the results are so good you might skip the foundation This is a great serum to hydrate and prep the skin before putting on your other serums and products I use this straight after cleansing my skin wait a couple of minutes then follow up with other products in my routine It feels really great on my skin sinks in wonderfully and hydrates I even use it around my eyes Game changer for sure I love it this serum relieves the skin rash and lightens the spots on my face I received this product in this years Sephora Favorites Skincares Next Big Thing kit I didnt know about this brand beforehand and wasnt expecting much but this is absolutely my favorite serum now It is calming and effective My skin is noticeably softer and brighter after using it It blends in perfectly to my skincare routine and works well whenever I use AHAsBHAs I tried this on a whim cuz I was look for a serum that really delivers hydration I love it use this morning and night in the winter months I was very much impressed I have combination dry skin in the winter and combination oily in the summer but I see this working for all types of skin My skin around my eyes and lips show the most change I keep getting asked what I use After almost a month of using this serum my pores are tighter my skin looks more plumped and the redness of my skin has been diminished I struggled with redness for Some time mostly on my forehead and nose I see a significant improvement in the overall health of my skin This has become a staple product for me I use it twice a day let it sink into my skin for about 5 min and follow with moisturizer\\nread more i needed a good serum and after reading the reviews i decided to try this one i am so happy i did this stuff is amazing and after only using it a short time

This is a holy grail product in my skincare Ive repurchased it three times already and am preparing for a fourth round I have dry sensitive skin that is prone to redness This serum is so hydrating and makes my skin look even and plump and glowy I havent found a serum to match it The Sephora worker recommended this because my skin was so dry I was hesitant based on the price in addition to my usual lotions But it had honestly made a different in my skin My skin feels much more hyrdrated It isnt as dry as it was before Ive been using it for about 2 months I would buy again when Im out Love this product I try a lot of products and this one is a winner I was hesitant at first to buy due to the price but honestly totally worth I had completely damaged my skin barrier and nothing really helped except this Perfect for sensitivereactive skin Basically does what it promises and have repurchased it Left my skin very moisturized and plump LOVE this product it is light weight and glides on Also

skin is dry and this stuff immediately hydrates and makes my skin look more youthful I also suffer from occasional redness and havent had that issue at all since using this I highly recommend im on my 5th bottle Absolutely love this it is a water serum i put all over my face including my eyes It makes my skin plump glow hydrated and smooth first step after primer before additional serum or moisturizer Wow I am blown away from this serum I have acne prone skin and most serums breaks me out I can only use Tatcha C serum As I get older I knew that I need another serum to hydrate my skin and I am so glad that the SA suggested this during my perk facial Love it Its so light and the best part is that it doesnt break me out I have been using it for a week and my skin definitely got more hydrated and glowing My favorite daytime serum yet\\nread more After seeing this posted on chrissytiegen stories on Instagram of course I had to try This is a great product that truly does help the texture of your skin Love it I love these pads so much With my sensitive skin it is nice to have a product that makes such an impact without causing redness and irritation Ive already purchased my 2nd box Amazing  I love them At home spa Great investment This is a great at home option if youre looking for a way to save money in between spa visits I am never without these pads I use 23 times per week The results are visible immediately and over time your skin just has great texture and a brightness to it They are great in combination with a hydrating mask or sleeping cream I love this peel and use it faithfully 3 times a week it has the effect I desire and doesnt dry my skin out Absolutely LOVE these pads I go over my face with it at night and wake up with smooth skin Its great for when I have a break out because it just gets it out and its ready to extract the day after Im obsessed with the smell too Tip half a pad is plenty I cut mines in half and it lasts me longer This product has made my 50year old skin bounce back beautifully after a very dehydrating winter After a week of using the wipes 2xweek my skin is so much smoother and my makeup looks flawless without the need for heavy coverage or layers of primer Im a skeptic about skincare products that promise transformation but after finishing my first box Im convinced The only criticism I have is in this advertisement The photo supposedly shows a womans forehead before and then after 2 weeks of use The problem is this isnt a daily use product Are they suggesting we use it daily for rapid results or that theres a miracle transformation in this womans forehead after using just 2 to 4 wipes in 2 weeks time\\nread more This product is honestly a god send Ive only used it three times so far and after the third use I woke up feeling like I was back in my early 20s  I am presently 28 going on 29 Not only does this product brighten but it evens out skin tone and feeling like a youth again I have some hyperpigmentation left over from break outs here and there and honestly after just three uses I can honestly say I notice a huge difference Thank you Dr Dennis Gross for making these wonderful made easy pads Great product Id recommend to people I know looking for evenness brightness and a dose of youth\\nread more One of the best peels ever made in my opinion Its gentle enough not to sting and you can see results immediately I bought for myself and my mom whose skin has deep wrinkles and sun damage It helps so much with clarity break outs texture Make sure you swipe over face 23 times and do not rinse Just apply serum and moisturizer Also I use as series2 weeks every 6 months I recieved a 3 pack sample of these in one of my subscription boxes and I fell in love with them Even after the first use My HUSBAND who wouldnt notice if I nest him to death with a flip flop even said your skin looks great what did you do I was sold And still am I swear by them asked for some at Christmas and will get a 2nd box at Tax Time You girls know thats when you buy the stuff you would otherwise have to sell a kidney to afford This is so worth the money\\nread more I received these in a Sephora Play box They have a light smell but I didnt find it unpleasant The pad is a good size and is wellsaturated but not overly with the product The pad isnt abrasive and my skin felt nice after using It felt a little tighter didnt irritate my skin and it looked more radiant the next day These are a little pricey but if youre got the money to spend I think theyd be worth it One of my absolute favourite peels I find the alpha beta line too strong for regular use but these are great I see a difference the next day every time I use one My skin just glows and looks so fresh and it really helps my pores look minimized These peels are amazeballs I use it after I do the 2step Dr Gross alpha beta peels a total game changer My skin looks so amazing the next day I highly recommend it They are a bit pricey but well worth the splurge I received 2 samples in one of my play boxes I read reviews online before using and they were amazing reviews So I finally tried and ummmm it works Now I only used once and the wrinkles in my forehead were close to gone the next morning I do feel like they may be coming back but only used it once I would totally buy a full package of these Hands down the best peel retinol pads on the market They turn your skin from meh to yay in one night Youre glowing and your sling feels smooth the flaws erased Dennis Gross is amazing Though Im not necessarily a fan of the daily peels go ahead you can judge me these ones are amazing I honestly didnt want to love this because of the price tag but after receiving a sample in my PLAY box a few months ago I had to buy the full size I have combination skin that breaks out due to hormones I use these pads twice per week along with the dr dennis gross extra strength daily peel twice per week alternating days and my skin is the best its ever been Although Im 24 and not necessarily too wrinkly yet per say I live in a city where my skin is exposed to pollution daily and spent years without ever touching sunscreen to my face  my skin was starting to look congested dull and prematurely aging These pads were a godsend My skin is better looking than when I was in college Its glowing tight and refreshed looking for the first time and I rarely break out if ever after two months of using these products For those of you who like instant gratification I noticed a huge difference when I woke up the very first time I tried this My esthetician also highly recommended this brand\\nread more The best peel pad ever usedIt has done magic on my skin I wanted to buy this product for a long time but didnt because I thought my concealer and tea tree oil will do it However I bought it and it covers my pimples better than the concealer Something I wasnt expecting at all It also removed my pimple in 1 day It got to the point where I could press a warm towel on my skin to remove the pimple Love this product and wished I bought it a long time ago This is the best colored spot treatment I have ever used and even saves me time from applying a spot treatment at home from working so well throughout the day Application is easy after washing and moisturizing I just pat and blend it out over my blemishes By the end of the day my blemishes come out as I remove it and cleanse my face at night People noticed the difference in clarity it has provided me I absolutely recommend this product as a former cosmetic retail employee\\nread more It covers my blemishes with ease without making me look cakey This not only covers my blemishes but it also helps my skin I have seen much improvement ever since I started using this I honestly dont understand all the bad reviews This stuff works great for me Its buildable it dries up my spots and it dries down quickly unless you put it on too thickly and it never makes my skin feel too tight The Light is a little too dark for me not terribly as it disappears under my Bye Bye Foundation so this time Im ordering it in Fair I dont have horrible cystic acne just a zit here or there I think it probably wouldnt be a huge help for cystic acnethat requires more intensive drugs than thisbut I think it does a great job of helping my occasional breakouts heal up while covering them up\\nread more I love this product It blends very well and gives enough coverage without being heavy Most days this is the face makeup I wear I liked this product It lasts a long time and even when it doesnt necessarily dry out pimples it definitely prevents them from getting worse I would purchase this again Finally a concealer I love I got this as a sample and the first time I used it my husband said I was glowing We took pictures that day and I didnt even need a filter lol So I purchased the full size immediately I love this product so much that I dont even use foundation anymore I dont have time to put full make up on nowadays and this product just save me from showing up to work like a zombie with dark spots This concealer is definitely worth trying if you have breakout prone skin It covers evenly and blends really well This stuff is like my own genie in a bottle I have fair skin and work in a veterinary clinic where the animal hair is constantly making me red and causing breakouts Ive noticed a tremendous difference in my skin quality since using this on those little red blemishes Even my boyfriend has commented on how nice my skin looks now AMAZING product Covers without making acne worse the most amazing concealer ever i have cystic acne and ive tried everything this covers it up without looking cakey and in conjunction with my dermatologist prescribed medicines has made a drastic different in my face texture and overall appearance i highly recommend I really love La Mer products I have extremely sensitive skin and have rosacea This seems to really hydrate and calm my skin as well as diminish redness I love it so far I got a deluxe sample of this and have been using it twice a day for three weeks Follow with Drunk Elephant BHydra serum in the morning and follow with La Mer moisturizing cream at night Since adding this serum to my routine my skin looks and feels great No more dry cheeks and tightness this winter Fine lines are also gone Have to bite the bullet and buy the full size Ive been trying to find a really good serum and this is by far the best one Ive ever used OK so Ive gotta say this is the first La Mer product I bought I got it as a gift to myself in my last year of my 20s and because I started to noticed some fine lines noooooo bueno I use it at night and I love the way my skin looks in the morning In the summer months I wear sunscreen during the day and this stuff at night In the winter I wear this plus sunscreen and my skin sings I have also noticed that it has decreased my fine lines Worth the splurge and honestly I use this every OTHER night and it does the trick to stretch it out for sure TREAT YOSELF\\nread more Ive been using this serum for over two years and although Ive tried to find something cheaper I just cant get away from this one With super dry skin in the winter this serum gives the perfect boost of hydration I cant go without it and in the summer i usually wear as my last step with no additional moisturizer needed I use this serum religiously every morning if nothing else I would always apply this serum after my toner Im about to buy for the third time\\nread more One application and I swear it took 5 years off my skin Im a 39 year old man This stuff is amazing Definitely worth the money Absorbs in a second and skin looks glowy and soft straight after Perfect for winter since it locks moisture really well love this hydrating serum Im been using a retinol and this helps with the drying and sensitivity also is great for when recuperating from a laser treatment since theres a lot of other moisturizers with too many chemicals This is amazing for any skin concern First time trying LA MER  omg it works so good I use it at night at wake up with the best skin My skin is feeling and get better daily I will be restocking soon  trying out more from this line One pump is a dime size so it does last a long time for the price Im a La Mer fan this product is different than other La Mer products I use it doesnt smell as good and is very watery BUT it has improved a chemical burn that I had from another product I had used My skin feels more soft I dont have many wrinkle issues but if you are looking for your skin to be very hydrated and improve texture this is for you I received a sample and boy was I impressed in as little as 2 days I saw fine diminish and my face was more hydrated  I m combo skin and not everything works for me  I didnt want this to work for me because its expensive But I love how my face looks after wearing this  Im addicted Lol ooh well beauty has a price  Im 36 wcombo skin Perfect hydrator feels very light on the skin I love La Mer skincare and this is another good surprise to me This serum is so moisturizing its perfect for using as first serum in winter or use by itself in summer The anti aging serums from La Mer are good at anti aging but in winter I still feel dry After adding this I dont feel dry anymore I used to use oil as first serum in winter but sometimes I get breakouts and it doesnt feel as hydrating as this serum This is extremely light weight doesnt break me out at all and it smells like a more scented version of typical La Mer scent Ill repurchase\\nread more Saw and felt instant results from a sample I received and purchased it on the spot It left my skin so smooth and supple I fell in love with it instantly I had a problem skin day when I tried it today and this saved my face today My skin seems to need a lot of exfoliation  my complaint about most peels is that they dont do enough I know this one is worth the money because Every day I use a scrub or chemical exfoliant some days both Even so after awhile my skin looks dull  flaky  I need More Ive tried dozens of peels but only a couple were really helpful  they were both discontinued So with clogged shelves  lots of wasted  oops I never get around to returns I was thinking Id just have to go pro But now I dont Finally one that works I got it as a sample tried it went to buy it  it was temporarily sold out which tells me other people loved it too  The day after I used it my husband commented on how nice my skin looks I would guess this would be too much for some people and I havent tried every Single peel out there it feels like that tho but this is the best Ive found by a big margin Since I was otherwise going to pay for professional peels the 90 that seemed kinda steep now seems like a bargain  Im grateful to have found it Try it if you need serious exfoliating\\nread more I think Iam sold after using a small sampleIts pure magic My face is as perfect as its gonna get now with this I dont know about the price but probably worth it I will have to get one for my sister too I received this as a sample and I am completely in love It made my skin so soft and moisturized I have sensitive rosacea skin and this was surprisingly gentle I will definitely be purchasing Incredible I noticed a visible difference in the appearance and texture of my skin after a single use This stuff works It made my face much smoother and it decreased the severity of my uneven skin tone It also left my face looking much brighter and with a healthy glow The tingling sensation is amazing when you put the mask on because its not too strong but you know its working When I washed it off omg my skin is soft looks radiant and my impurities were OUT I got a sample and have only used it once but If I get the whole bottle and do this every 2 weeks my skin would thank me for it I have owned and used this peelmask for a little under 6 months now Ive used it regularly once a week or every other week I like exfoliating and dont have really sensitive skin so I have a few that I cycle through hoping to find my ONE Im discovering is there isnt a 1 exfoliator I want a couple I want baby facial or goops instant facial on my counter because theyre effective as heck I like the way they feel and theyre strong and really good for days when I really need a good hard exfoliation But sometimes Sometimes I am on my period my skin is acting up and puffy and I just dont want that rip my skin off feeling Sometimes its Sunday and I want to mask excessively Sometimes I want to wear a mask for an hour and not have my family ask me what the heck is on your face And on those days this is the one for me Let me tell you why I love this 1 I LOVE the smell Its limey but not overwhelming 2 Its creamy and not gritty When I know my skin is off I really dont want to scrub away my barrier with any grit This has none Its like a velvety cream Because of this as I said I can wear it without being stared at 3 Its effective Its not as strong as baby facial and it has zero grit to it but it definitely leaves a glow and I do feel like its done its job when its done It feels a lot like Tatas resurfacing mask Gentle but effective 4 I love the packaging Its pretty and I like having it on my counter As I said Ive had it for about 6 months now its less than half gone It comes with a neat little spoon It has been something of a task to keep track of that but I have and Im glad because I havent put my fingers in the tub once Yes this is pricey But its worth it At this rate Ill only need to replace about once a year and when it runs out I will replace it It annoys me how many reviews there are on this product who received a free one two years ago and now theres barely any reviews on it Its a good find\\nread more Great peel I love the way my face feels after using this peel expensive and amazing I was recommended by Sephora to use this to prevent acne my skin was so soft after a 20min treatment when I washed away the peel my skin felt refreshing it was brighten right away and it was so much smoother to apply serum and moisturizer I believe it is a very concentrated product of glycolic acid then sodium hydroxide I m guessing that the amount of sodium hydroxide might have assisted the action of glycolic acid hence making this product more effective than others I have used that said Sunday Riley sulfur mask is still more effective for acne treatment this would be more for regular maintenance\\nread more What a great product Made my skin look and feel fantastic There is a bit of a tingle when you first apply but that doesnt last long I use this in conjunction with the Lancer Method for the best benefit It also smells so good I use it 2x per week Love this peel The blend of glycolicphyticand retinol reduces the appearance of discoloration which Im starting to notice Its effective but gentle I never notice redness even if I leave it on for 15 minutes Best beauty product I purchased this year Noticable difference in my skin tonetexture by the 2nd use LOVE this product Absolutely love this mask It works Really do what is supposed to do Brighten hyper pigmentation and un even skin tones Love  love  love  This product makes my face feel silky smooth and my skin looks so nice after I dont use this often as it was so expensive but i use it as a treat and its so worth the money I leave this on for an hour and then rinse off you dont need much just a thin layer on the face and you will see results  This product is AMAZING I have fair oily extremely sensitive skin and I have been diagnosed with rosacea I have tried hundreds of products to help remove the redness and treat rosacea breakouts but nothing has worked except medication prescribed by my dermatologist However I cannot take this medication while trying to conceive or while pregnant and my skin has been such a mess This Lancer caviar lime acid peel is the ONLY overthecounter product that has calmed down my rosacea flairs and it has helped me feel so much more confident This peel smells divine and really works It is worth every penny I have found that a tiny amount think 18 of a teaspoon covers my entire face so this product will last a long time I cant recommend it highly enough Go try it in a Sephora store\\nread more This product is amazing As soon as you apply it to your face you can start to feel it working Ive noticed my skin is a lot brighter and smoother My discoloration has faded a ton and its super moisturizing and doesnt dry out my skin Highly recommended i took a chance buying the full size of this peel before trying but I really like it so far I dont think its especially expensive for the size compared to other masks and peels since you really dont need very much for each application You can definitely feel it working which I like Ive only used it 34 times so far but am noticing results and feel that this peel is a good complement to the other products in my routine\\nread more The price tag may be high but you dont use a lot for each mask Postmask my skin feels soft

face When I washed it off my fave was so silky smooth I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this acid peel Best Vitamin C serum Im obsessed with serums and Had been trying all different brands of c serums

some previously stubborn areas and hope continued use will eliminate them altogether This is my first vitamin C product so cant compare to other options out there At this point I would not hesitate to repurchase Love all of my DDG products I have noticed a reduction in dark spots and an overall brighter complexion within my first week of use Would recommend and will continue to use through my first full bottle to see the final results Not the most luxe scented serum because there is NO fragrance added Just the natural scent of the ingredients This is the first thing I noticed as a high end serum connoisseur but I do not mind at all after continued use for 2 weeks I already see a huge difference in skin clarity smoothness and firmness Will continue to use this until bottle is done as a treatment My skin always loves vitamin C and this one is no exception Great product\\nread more These people who complain about the bottle being half full they crack me up You are paying for 1 ounce of product and there is one ounce of product in the bottle The bottle needs to be larger to accommodate the pump mechanism No one is trying to cheat you Anyway I have only been using this in combo with the other items from the Skin Heroes kit for about 4 days now but already feel a firmness and plumpness to my just beginning to get crepey skin This definitely turned back the clock a little I am

face has never felt so soft than after using this mask Would repurchase without any doubt Really gentle subtle results but that just makes it all the better for weekly use The price is completely justifiable because no matter how often I use the mask it always seems to last for months I feel this way about all the Caudalie masks I have used this glycolic peel 3x so far It is gentle and effective Hormonal acne scars around and under chin and jaw have already noticeably lightened  which amazed me Pores are more clear I use this 12xweek I follow the glycolic peel up with the Caudalie moisturizing mask that I leave on overnight In the AM I use a mild cleanser and gently buff with a soft wash cloth and have more radiant skin and beautiful makeup application\\nread more Alone I didnt see a difference honestly its soo gentle and I dont like using too many products daily as some have suggested because of my sensitive skin But using the before another facial mask WOW it really gave me better results Its like it peels that initial layer and readies your skin for whats coming next I actually regrets wasting it for weeks without trying a combo I definitely will repurchase Gentle and effective This was my first foray into chemical exfoliators and Im hooked Im 35 and turns out that chemical exfoliators are necessary because our skin doesnt renew like it used to This helps it feel smooth and clean I used it a few times a week and love it Amazing mask My skin is glowbig and bright after It says to apply a thick layer like the girl in the picture I dont put it on that thick but I see noticeable results I just used up some other face masks and Im going to be putting this one into the rotation twice a week Cant wait to see even more results i have sensitive dry skin and this didnt irritate it or make any dry patches more noticeable i had acne and occasionally will get a big breakout but this noticeably helps with the leftover texture from that you can see a difference in one use and even more so within a couple i would definitely buy it again This product has helped my face fade away spots it even minimized my pores and some blemishes disappeared My face looks plumped brighter and smooth My skin is so sensitive and this product is very very gentle on my face The product is creamy and will last for months I will DEFINITELY keep buying it Is a very good

these keep my skin in really good shape Ive even tried to stop taking them or try a cheaper one and my breakouts come right back I hope they never discontinue these I waited 2 months to write this review Yall Let me tell youuu I was hoping this wouldnt work because they stink but i refuse to live without these I had weird hormonal acne that only formed on my cheeks Sometimes cystic but usually just a cluster of small pimples and it was so ugly lol Im 21 and have never had bad skin but it started forming at 19 I cut out dairy and basically everything else people said were bad for skin and it

I didnt want to take those forever I was looking for another oral solution These pills have worked REALLY well for me After 2 months I switch to only taking once a day I would definitely give this a try This product is unexplainable I have struggled with acne for as long as I can remember This is the first review I have ever done on any product because this ACTUALLY WORKS I was even on proactive at one point but my acne was still coming through I have tried everything you could name but it seemed as if I was at a loss I was even prescribed certain birth control pills to help with my acne but even then I was still having a constant battle with my acne Nothing was lessening my breakouts but when I tell you I have no acne on my face at all I promise No exaggeration I was always so insecure with my skin but this product gave me all the self confidence I need Please if you are hesitant about this please I beg of you to give this a try I will never not use this supplement I am so thankful I gave this a chance I could not be any more thankful God Bless you Murad\\nread more So I have a tendency to use all kinds of different things and not let my skin get used to anything I have a beauty box subscription and I just like trying new stuff I got sick of my face getting red at the drop of a hat I have a touch of rosacea and then things like temperature alcohol consumption and stress would make me go beet red so the lovely associate at Sephora recommended I use either this or Dr Jart daily I liked the texture and smell of this serum better than Dr Jart so I committed to using it every day twice a day One pump is sufficient for covering my whole face perfectly and the smell is lovely While its a natural fragrance its still an added fragrance so my bff cant use it which makes me sad I now use it twice a day religiously and it took 46 weeks but now I really dont get red at all any more in any circumstance I have the sniffles right now and my nose isnt even red from blowing it so much I need less redness coverage with makeup and I dont notice a ton of temperature changes either The bottle will probably last me about two months but its worth it to me to continue buying it If you use it religiously it will work\\nread more Love how my skin feels when I put it on It really does help to decrease my redness and it smells great this works literally amazing like a miracle Ive never seen better antiredness cream I tried it and the next morning my skin was so much more clear nothing else was working and I was shocked what a difference it makes its well worth the money I have had light rosacea for years and I feel like this product really helped to reduce my redness My skin is incredibly sensitive and this serum did not burn or irritate my skin upon application It didnt create any little bumps either  I would highly recommend this product I notice a visible difference in my acne and cystic acne when I run out of this product It reduces my redness keeps my skin calm and feels great I apply it under my prescription creams and give it a few minutes to soak in I flinch every time at the high pricetag but it always pays for itself This stuff saved my skin i have supper pale skin thats dry sensitive so i often would experience redness after washing plus found it impossible to exfoliate without breaking out Not only did this reduce the redness in my face i can actually use chemical exfoliators without breaking out Its the same brand of exfoliator i was using before and after I still see the benefits from the exfoliators this stuff just strengthen my skin barrier Overall the irritation and redness has decreased 10 folds Holy grail stuff for those with supper sensitive skin I use it every day Should note it doesnt clog pores at all Really Recommend\\nread more I Looooooove this product I have really sensitive skin Whenever I got allergy I put it on the areas that were itchy and red It stopped the itchiness right away Great product Will definitely repurchase it Love love love this serum Keeps my sensitive oily acne prone skin happy year round I use it in conjunction with the moisturizer and both are wonderful Definitely recommend to anyone with similar skin issues I love this serum It does not irritate and reduces redness It also helps prep my skin before makeup as I feel it does add some moisture to my skin Amazing for eczema sufferers I recently had a flare up on my neck that was extremely uncomfortable and this came to my rescue It helped calm the redness and itchiness and was even better when I paired it with Dermalogicas Redness Calming Essence and Rens Global Day Moisture Almost instant relief Have seen beautiful results in 4 days Skin is noticeably brighter totally worth the money and will continue to buy Only con is packaging I have long acrylic nails so it makes it reaaaally hard to push out the serum every morning  night I love this product I have tried several vitamin C products and this one has made the most noticeable difference to my skin in reducing dark spots scarring and evening tone It also smells nice I am 51 and very dry with sun damage I have used so many vit c serums and am shocked that after only 1 week of using this I see a huge difference in the brightness and discoloration on my checks and forehead I have been using this product every day in the morning only and will continue to do I love this product I apply 2 drops directly i have read of others applying it with moisturizers onto my face One week made a lot of difference My freckles are lighter skin brighter pores smaller Like magic This is the first skin care product from Clinique that I tried I struggled finding a pure Vitamin C Ascorbic Acid serum that didnt oxidize or irritate my skin Drunk Elephants C Firma while a quality product was too strong for my skin and oxidized too quickly for me Ive been using Cliniques formula for only a few days now it I will definitely be repurchasing My skin is visibly brightened and evened out  Im AA with meddeep skin tone and Ive always had clear skin but struggle with an even skin tone darker jaw area common for women of color for as along as I can remember The first day I put this on I didnt think it was working because it didnt sting myth I know but it I gave it a few days and definitely saw the difference Vitamin C is generally a product you have to be patience with and wont always see overnight results Great formula and genius packaging\\nread more Love My skin is glowing immediately after use and it makes such a difference under makeup I became a fresh pressed Vitamin C junkie a little over a year ago The first one I ever tried was by No7 and it worked quite well at first After some time though I wasnt noticing the same glowing results and decided to look for other options Im a Sunday Riley and Tatcha skincare fanatic but really wanted to stick to the fresh pressed Vitamin C serums which neither of those companies offer Connie who works at my local Sephora recommended Cliniques version to me I already use their Moisture Surge Eye Concentrate and Clinique ID hydrating jelly and love both so naturally I was excited to give this a try as well Ive been officially using their Fresh Pressed Vitamin C Serum now for approximately 8 months and I am still just as happy with the results as I was on day one The last Fresh Vitamin C I used seemed to stop giving the same results after about five months of use This product still brightens and boosts my skins appearance Ive noticed a huge difference in fine lines and unevenness My skin glows after every use If I run out for a few days before Im able to get to the store to buy more I can tell a major difference in my skins appearance Im 42 and honestly get mistaken for being in my early to mid 30s all the time Ive always taken very good care of my skin thanks to my mother insisting I did so starting in my preteen years I know my skin care regimen all these years has been a major contributor in how I look now in my 40s but without this Vitamin C serum my skin looks dull You can use this serum alone although I recommend using it in tandem with your favorite night or day moisturizer at first If youve never tried Fresh Pressed Vitamin C before because it can cause irritation to some peoples skin as can any new product Never introduce more than 1 new product into your skin care regimen at a time so you know which product to eliminate if any adverse side effects occur I Hope you give this product a try and love it as much as I have\\nread more Ive used this product for only 3 days  I already see a huge difference Ive tried a lot of home remedies and masks in the past but none seemed to work I tried a few products from the ordinary and they helped a little bit not much After my friend told me to use vitamin C I saw this and decided to give it a shot Really suggest using this product This serum really works Bought this for my mom and it helped smoothen out her skin and reduce fine lines She is obsessed and I would recommend it to everyone I never write reviews but just had to over this serum It is the most amazing Vitamin C product I have ever used hands down I have been using it nightly and day for a week and dark spots around my eyes and cheeks have virtually disappeared And I have slight rosacea around my nose and cheeks and it did not irritate it It literally looks like my skin has been lit within Try this product You wont be sorry Loved this The 2nd or 3rd day I used this I noticed immediate results my skin looked brighter and my skin was much tighter i do wish there was more product in the bottle and the smell isnt bad its just not amazing but so far this is my favorite serum and I will buy this agin This is great I am not a person that notices changes with products so cant tell you the effects But I love the vitamin C formula I mix it with the Vichy Mineral 89 in the morning it absorbs quickly and I apply a moisturizing sunscreen after and its perfect My skin didnt react to it so its great I must admit I was a skeptic I have tried a myriad of treatments including professional facials for my congested pores and nothing has worked until this After just one use the blackheads on my chin and nose were essentially gone and my skins texture is smooth Would recommend 100 times over it really works I like it a lot It makes my pores cleaner without drying out the skin This product is amazing Its really cool because the cream and the scrubber work together to really extract blackheads whiteheads and other oil from your face It just brought everything that was in my pores to the surface and then scrubbed it all away I might be addicted to using this Super effective I have had very stubborn blackheads on my nose and chin for years This completely eradicates the blackheads on my chin and greatly reduces the amount on my nose Plus it leaves my skin feeling super soft Its not a miracle product but if you suffer from persistent blackheads its definitely a good find for your arsenal Love this stuff We took a before and after picture of my teen and in two weeks it made a huge difference Will definitely repurchase So good You can feel the difference and see the difference quickly Ive tried a lot of blackhead removing options and this is my favourite for sure i have oily acne prone skin mainly on my nose and i have tried multiple stuff that hasnt worked between a charcoal peel off mask to a blackhead mask it didnt work But this stuff is AMAZING The first use i already noticed a difference would recommend I love this eye serum My under eyes are very dry have dark circles and very prone to age me After using Algenist POWER for 2 months I see a noticeable difference There is less dryness dark circles are lessened and my eyes simply look better I have tried dozens of under eye creams from cheap to very expensive and this is probably the best Pros Moisturizing longlasting effective wrinkle keeperatbay Cons A bit slow to dry Brand context I use Algenists liquid collagen occasionally Love love love this product My ultimate favourite in algenist What a difference to my eyelid No more crepeness Crows feet less and better youthful looking skin under eye I am almost 58 and have wrinkles My eyes are most definitely improved Love this product Wont be without Been using it for over a year and its my holy grail Had puffy eyes I could not get rid of and this work like magic I use this with their renewal balm and my fine lines are gone To be honest I wasnt sure at first if it was the eye cream but after a few months of use I know this works I am in airplanes all the time and between the dryness and lack of any kind of sleep routine it can take its toll but this wiped away all those little lines and restored some moisture Love love love I was so heartbroken when the gel was discontinued because it was the best I found I tried a couple of products in between trying this because of its price but they did not work out I bit the bullet and bought this product and glad I did Like it so far Have only had it for a month so well have to wait I dont say this often but Algenists Power Advanced Eye serum has MADE A DIFFERENCE in my eye discoloration Its also helped with lines but for me the most significant improvement has been in the reduction of dark circles  and Im certainly not getting any more sleep Love this eye serum I have dry skin am in my late 40s and have serious under eye circles This serum is fantastic Does it eliminate my under eye circles No but nothing at any price range and I use La Mer for my face cream  Im willing to shell out for something that works ever has This serum does lighten them though and I definitely think its helping to diminish the look of fine lines I do pat a bit of my face moisturizer over top as I need a lot of hydration but when I forget to do that I find this serum is pretty darn moisturizing on its own I have sensitive skin but Ive had zero issues with this product Highly recommend it\\nread more I tried this in the store and thought it absorbed so well I had to buy it Its only been a few weeks so I cant judge if it is making a difference This is the first product from this line that I have purchased Always searching for a eye serum for aging skin tried 3Lab and a lot of expensive brands so far this one get the job done and price is reasonable I just used the sample and I would hands down drop 70 on this Wow Best eye cream Ive ever used in my life A little goes a long way so this bottle will last you a looong time The formula is so light and gentle The skin around my eyes has never felt so soft My dark circles just EVAPORATED yall My bags are GONE WHERE did my wrinkles go I am only in my 20s so it just got rid of some fine lines But wow just wow Its going to do something for you\\nread more Love this eye serum I have sensitive skin and this product does not bother my skin You apply this underneath and on the eye lids It is not greasy so you can easily apply makeup after in the morning My daughter told me to try this She has a friend that is into skincare Love it Glad I got it The hype is real My puffy eyes are much improved and fine lines are disappearing Recommended I have been using this product for about two weeks My skin seems smoother and a dark spot I had seems to be almost gone Love this serum Decided at 29 that I needed to get into more preventative face care asked for several different serums for Christmas and then tried each for two weeks and this one was by far the best and still is I actually realized how much I liked it because I noticed that I liked the way my face looked in photos more with this serum It is a thicker stickier serum so apply with precision and dont bank on being able to move it around after a few seconds Its expensive but the little bit lasts a long time\\nread more Ive been using this since 2014 I turned 36 yesterday and had to show my coworkers proof I was not 26I barely place a drop on my hand and smooth over face and neck every morning with a foundation brush Its pricey but worth it and lasts quite a long time I got this today at Sephora and used it ONCE I may have just imagined it based on all the great reviews but I swear this stuff works with the 1st use I did cleanse and tone first but I dont think toning is required Whenever I put this on I feel a bit shiny and brand new and then my face absorbs it and starts working its magic It feels so good and comfortable on my face I love it  the best  for this weather  This stuff is amazing I have some age spots on my chest that Ive used every product imaginable on including chemical peels and nothing even touched them I got a sample of this in my Ipsy bag and have been putting it on the age spots for about a month Every single age spot has either vanished or is in the process of vanishing I just ordered a new bottle At first I was disappointed that the FRESH serum was not a liquid After using it for awhile I really like this serum Feels good as I put it on but it leaves my skin shiny I wish I didnt love this so much because it is pricey but its so worth it I have dry sensitive skin and this keepse dewy and fresh I also noticed a significant difference on my fine lines This serum is worth it I saw result after just a few uses this serum does tighten skin and shape face contour Didnt cause break out for my combo sensitive skin However I dispense a few drops into my palms then slightly press on my face and neck so it wont be too thick I had been using this product very happily and changed to Le Crue by Caudalie when it came out I found that product very drying on my skin and have since returned to this It is moisturizing and works better on my dry skin Leaves my face smooth abs great scent Caudalie products are reliable This product delivers results in a week It was non irritating and I loved the texture My skin felt tighter and brighter Definitely worth the price I bought this product a month ago and I can already see the difference My skin stays hydrated longer during the day and I can see the fine lines softening Loving it Its the best I have tried others cheaper and more expensive and this is the winner Feel it working and it lifts my face and tightens It was my first product and thought others would do the same Wrong I am back to stay Ps No issues with sensitivity I am starting to develop a real obsession with Caudalie As someone who has tried countless firming products over the last couple years I can tell you this works And pretty much immediately I use it morning and night and can visibly see my skin looking tighter but also more supple I wake up every morning and touch my face and it just feels fuller Lol This product has definitely obtained holy grail status for me and I will be a lifelong user\\nread more I love this product I have very sensitive allergic skin and have had no issues using this My over40 skin looks and feels firmer and smoother It dries clean and isnt oily or sticky perfect Creates a supple and soft skin that seems to be a bit firmer than before Hoping that as I continue daily use I will see even greater results This has been my favorite serum for years Iv had times when I stopped useing it for awhile and i can tell a big difference when I start using it again It makes my skin look and feel amazing I have high cheek bones and this serum lifts that area nicely to complement them more I hope they never discontinue this stuff This product is pricey and worth every penny I use it morning and night under my regular lotions and have noticed a huge difference even after just a couple days of use fine lines be gone My skin tone has evened out under eye wrinkles are so much better I could go on and on But I wont I have very sensitive skin and react to almost everything so this product was a life saver for me I had used Caudalies Resveratol eye lifting balm and it really worked so I decided to buy a face serum also This serum has a creamy texture Im not a fan of the smell honestly but considering the benefits the smell is a small con The serum goes on smooth absorbs quickly Its neither too heavy nor too light just perfect level of moisture for my combination skin I usually dont even use a moisturizer on top of it Im 52 and going through a stressful period nowadays  plus multiple health issues but despite these factors my skin looks amazing since Ive started using this serum It seems supple strengthened from within and firmed It looks more fresh and youthful than it usually does strongly recommend this product It works ladies give it a try\\nread more Does just what it says My skin is visibly lifted and firmed It is not sticky and quickly disappears when you put it on I can also see results in my appearance as well It smells great too I have been using this for just over 1 month now I have seen a HUGE difference in my skin and my breakouts and inflammation have been completely tamed I still have some redness and the odd breakout but the deep acne has gone away This serum is so light and doesnt make your skin oily at all I really like this product Im in my mid 30s and I still breakout Ive been using the face wash day and night and I use this product at night it dried my face out using it twice a day Its doing its job by keeping my face from total breakout I still get 1 or 2 zits here and there Love this product I have tried lots of products for acne but none of them seem to work as good as this one Holy Grail I use this more as a preventative treatment than a spot treatment Worn under moisturizer at night it smooths out my skin sliiiightly diminishes the darkness of scars but definitely helped prevent acne flair ups Any hormonal acne is less severe and disappears much more quickly One of the best nonprescription products Ive tried I started using this in my skin care routine 2 months ago and I LOVE it Salicylic Acid is so important to my routine now It has helped reduce the amount of black heads and reduce my pore size significantly I highly recommend adding this to your routine Love this doesnt dry my skin out at all and has been a real life saver for my face I tend to only experience pesky hormonal acne and this really makes a difference I have sensitive skin and hormonal chin acne that usually goes out of control is sore trapped under the skin and inflamed I used this three times a day and it helps with drawing the acne to the surface clearing it up quickly and its not red and sore Ive never had anything work like this before This stuff is worth every penny I got this as a free sample but will buy when I run out Ive been struggling

of dryness with the products but after that it completely cleared up my issues The moisturizer is meh but Ive already purchased the full sizes of everything else and would absolutely recommend this for anyone who feels lost in their acne issues \\nread more After one use this made a difference in my cystic acne I didnt even use the spot treatmentjust the cleanser salicylic acid treatment and the moisturizer I have only had this set for a week but what a positive difference it has made I went nearly makeup free to work today which is something I NEVER do I have combinationoily skin and at any time I have one or two whiteheads blackheads and even painful deep cysts despite washing my face frequently and using noncomedogenic makeup and skincare Ive followed the instructions for this kit but also supplemented with extra moisture since its cold and dry out by using the Lapis Herbivore facial oil under the Kate moisturizer during the day and the Olehenrikson vitamin c moisturizer at night After just a few days following this routine my skin looks clear and feels so bouncy and soft  I cant believe it The only issue I have is with the eradiKate spot treatment It smells really strongly of isopropyl alcohol and is a little painful when applied to spots I can only use it at night but it does seem to work well so I will keep using it\\nread more Love all the products Yes its a trial sized box obviously but they are great for travel You get a lot of product for what youre paying for The cleanser its really good I only use it at night but feels good on the skin The pink spot treatment is AWESOME I always had horrible pimples on my chin I tried a lot of creams before but nothing worked like this The pimples despair completely after 2 or 3 days COMPLETELY The moisturizer is ok too nothing really amazing but does the job I truly love Kate Somerville kits it works if you use it consistently Please do not try to use the acne treatments without the moisturizer because it will dry your skin and increase your breakouts At least thats what happened to me when I ran out of the moisturizer for few a while I found the moisturizers and the acne treatment in glass bottle to be the best You dont see results fast but definitely see a huge improvement overtime Btw their moisturizer is great\\nread more This product cleanses and moisturizes my sensitive and reactive skin so well I bought as a giftset to try it out and I fell in love with it and I plan to buy the fullsize products once this runs out I have been using this for about two weeks and my acne has decreased dramatically Definitely will get full size versions soon My skin is looking amazing And bonus perfect for travel Bought this my daughter who has issues with breakouts in her forehead and chin She loves it and keeps her face clear and well moisturized I have been using this set for about 2 weeks now I would say that it has really helped to clear some some hormonalstress related acne I was suffering from I would wash my face to remove makeup and then use the acne face wash followed by the two treatment products The oil free moisturizer is very light It is very good for around the house or under makeup that has SPF as it doesnt have any I have been trying to find products to clear my hormonal breakouts for a while and this cleared a lot of it up in a short amount of time 12 weeks Ive tried many products but this kit made such a huge difference in my skin Although its pricey it was definitely worth it for me I have combo skin and my main breakouts are around my hairline and forehead This really worked for me Okay guys so this is day 4 using this kit and IT CHANGED MY LIFE Listen the real stars are the salicylic acid treatment with retinol and the acne treatment I know for the acne treatment is supposed to be used as a spot treatment my boyfriend wen ahead and applied it to my whole face lol I have a lot of little bumps under my chin and neck making me look like a crunch bar and the next morning BOOM GONE Im so serious too The cleanser feels so rich and frothy  The moisturizer is really good too nothing fancy or game changing its just nice to pair with the salicylic acid treatment at night If youe been wanting to try this line this kit is supper dope But if you get something out of this definitely get the sulfur treatment and salicylic acid\\nread more Great collection to help my problem skin So far so good I was very sceptical at first when they told me to try this So far im very impressed With only one pump for my entire face my skin looks nourish hydrated and younger I can definitly say that Im going to buy again It is for sure part of my skin care routine forever My husband spends a lot of time in the elements for his hobbies and this bottle has saved his skin It took him awhile to use it everyday however once he started using it consistently he realized why he needed it It made his skin tone and texture more even and really nourished his face He is not a firm believer in preventing vs correcting I wish Id found this sooner I watch Dr Sandra Lees videos aka Dr Pimple Popper and I noticed that she recommends retinoid products to her patients with milia I decided to give this one a try and wow Im so glad I did Within 1 WEEK the milia under my eyes had improved and after using it for a few months theres been a huge difference The milia under my eyes are still there but theyve shrunken so much theyre barely noticeable Ive also noticed that I get fewer little whiteheads  I used to get them all over my face now I only have to deal with maybe 2 or 3 at a time Compared to other retinoid products out there this one is relatively inexpensive Im still using the first bottle I bought I got another one during the VIB sale and Ive had it for almost 4 months The only downside is that the smell is a little offputting I really wish Id taken before pictures for comparison\\nread more Soooo got this as a sample didnt know it was meant for dudesLOVE IT This serum and the Eye Rescue both came in the sample pack and I loved them both I will use and dont even care theyre for a dude This serum is so good no matter if its for men it does the work for women as welllove it Overall very pleased with product Ingredients and quality are on point Drys quickly No strong smell Good packaging to help protect air and light sensitive ingredients plus you get a decent amount of product for the price Just started using this so cannot say if it helps with fine lines but definitely leaves the skin very smooth plumped and well hydrated afterwards No greasy or sticky feeling whatsoever Light quick absorption and even though I personally havent been using daily theres a notable improvement on my skins texture and tone Interesting enough Ive been getting compliments on my skin every single day If I had started using this in my twenties Id probably still look like I was in my twenties No other product improves my skin as quickly or effectively I bought this for my husband and he loves it It magically reduces the look of fine lines without being greasy This product works great for ladies like others said My skin feels so pumped and dewy after just one use Lodeur est un peu masculine jen conviens  mais sutilise sans problème pour une femme Bonne quantité pour le rapport quantitéprix Teint lumineux Différence notable en quelques jours dutilisation I bought this product on a whim and I have not been disappointed I use it daily underneath my makeup and at night before bed dries very quickly It moisturizers and plumps my skin perfectly without feeling heavy The only draw back of this product is the smell its a little off putting but goes away very quickly My husband has a combination of oily and dry skin with a bit of redness on his cheeks He uses this everyday and puts it on right out of the shower It really helped his complexion The price is a bit steep for the size of the bottle but a little goes a long way I absolutely love the scent as well Subtle but nice I love their face oil Looking for an anti aging serum and found this Was in immediately after my first use Love it I have been using this product for 4 months and am very pleased with how it has worked for me I was looking for something nourishing that would not aggravate my sensitive skin and might help counter some acne damage Even when my skin is at its worst this serum does not cause stinging or redness unlike some other products I have found that the discoloration that you get after a a nasty pimple has disappeared and healed much faster after I started using this serum I cannot speak to the antiaging properties but it has make my skin as a whole feel much healthier The serum itself is lightweight and watery absorbs fairly quickly with no noticeable stickiness There is some faint scent but it disappears quickly\\nread more Ive been using this product for well over two years This product is marketed towards men  but that doesnt mean women cant use it It does have a slight manly smell during application but that quickly dissipates I find that one full pump is perfect for covering my face even around my eye area And I use another half a pump to cover my neck It does have a bit of a slick feeling during application but the serum sinks in within a minute A bottle lasts me 69 months so this product is pricey but definitely worth it compared to other higherend brands If you dont like the idea of committing to a 60 serum try one of their mini sampler kits that contains this product I fell in love with this product after receiving it as a sample in one of my Sephora online orders and Ive been using it ever since\\nread more I am a 58 yr young female w sensitive skin This has awesome ingredients and after using for a week has already gotten rid of the horizontal line on the side of my face It is moisturizing and i dont feel its sticky at all Again a lot of serums at sephora dont have these powerful ingredients I was trying to find a perfect serum for my father 51 then I received a sample from jack black and I tried it myself It is Amazing Good smell and not greasy at all My skin feel soft and well hydrated This serum is fantastic I love it I have struggled with hormonal cystic acne my whole life This product is INCREDIBLE I use it as an overnight mask In the morning my skin feels so smooth and my acne is 100 times better I wouldnt recommend it for sensitive skin but otherwise its perfect Dont give up As someone who is suffering from cystic hormonal painful mid 20s acne this mask has changed my life I have tried it all and after trying this and seeing results Im hopeful once again that there is still products out here that work and help My husband is obsessed with it No need to say more Oh it works for spot traitement for breakout I dont have acne so I cant help there Im pregnant and suffering from terrible hormonal acne This helps me keep it under control The smell is strong but I definitely dont pick things for my skin based on the smell This is super effective I really like this It does have a big sulfury smell but it goes on easily and doesnt sting except on open acne wounds I have because I just cant not pick _ Does a good job of clearing things up without overdrying or aggravating my very sensitive skin I have incredibly acne prone and oily skin I use this about once a week using the directions on the back and truly feel that this helps keep my acne at bay Smells like sulfur but it is made of sulfur and it doesnt seem to have added fragrance which is nice I am pretty sure that Sunday Riley is also cruelty free and vegan which is a great perk when looking for great skincare I have extremely sensitive skin and usually acne treatments like this can cause hives but this mask does not I use it on my nose and chin for my blackheads and only after 2 uses I already see a diminished appearance of them Im quite impressed from my sample and will purchase the full size which will probably last forever since its for small areas to keep the blackheads away As others have said holy grail I have extraordinarily stubborn skin that Ive finally gotten mostly under control at the end of my twenties with a combination of meds spironolactone birth control and a tried and true cocktail of micellar water face lotion for burn victims and retinoids But despite all of this I still get some hormonal acne monthly and it holds on for dear life Not with this Ive had some luck with sulfur in the past where other products have failed but this is in a league of its own It makes a difference as a spot treatment overnight\\nread more Perfect for pesky breakout as an over night treatment Strong sulfur odor but dissipates quickly I have combination skin so it tends to dry out my cheeks and right now since I am treating my adult acne with other products it not a favorable combination Regardless it is a keeper to have handy A musthave magic treatment when you have to stay up late This product does exactly what it says it does I have used it numerous times and thank my lucky stars that I found it Two hours of sleep no problem This product definitely helps with recovery Makes you skin feel like silk and it smells great too I understand where other reviewers expected a larger tube however this is not suppose to be an everyday product though you could if you wanted Im sure This is one of those emergency products that everyone should have in their back pocket I always have some on hand\\nread more I love this product a lot especially the smell but I wish they have bigger size of the cream  I have a newborn and sleep is hard to come by these days which does nothing good for my skin Using this mask has really helped my skin become less stressed and look less tired For the price point it was totally worth it You will thank yourself later I have used up one tube and it works really well Im a fulltime engineering student and staying up all night is probably like my weekly routine Whenever I feel dull and dehydrated on my skin I just apply a layer of this onto my face and I could rise with a healthy glow on my face Even though this does no good to my dark circles still it balances oil and water when my skin is dehydrated during awaken nights\\nread more Loved this cream Yeah its small but you dont need a lot Works well and smells so good I use this a little differently I use it every night before going to bed after cleaning my face Weirdly it solves my acne problem and my facial skin just loves it First of all yes it is small for the price Is it worth it Absolutely Its not meant to be used everyday When I do I notice a significant difference in my skin Friends and family have too If youre in the fence about it Id say give it a try Youll be glad you did For those of you who complain that the size of it is tiny  it is NOT meant to be used every night Its an express help for the days when you went to bed very late Look at Guerlains price tag for the skincare  this product is a STEAL Works just amazing I use this anytime I know I may not be getting much sleep or if I want to look particularly nice the next day I dont know what type of voodoo magic this cream holds but I always feel that I look fresh when I wake up It is a bit pricey but defintiely worth it I have no idea why they make this in deluxe sample size Id buy in bulk if I could It is that amazing Magical product Must try if u have to stay up late sometimes Saw a difference in my skin the very first time I used it and it smells so nice Stop reading reviews and just buy it Ive used this three times now and I love it Once i applied it at night knowing that i wasnt going to get more than 3 hours sleep and then again after my shower in the morning the other two times Ive managed it only in the morning but either way it perks my skin up so much and allows it to be smooth and hydrated for a light touch of foundation Yes it seems a little pricy but to be honest I was considering La Mer soft cream as an alternate which is nearly 3x the price for the same number of grams in a less sanitary container I will continue to buy this for important days and gift it to friends\\nread more This product is AMAZING Ive had scars since I was a teen and have been breaking out a lot lately from stress I will admit Im a popperits awful But after just two nights my skin was noticeably clearer Plus all the acne I had when I started disappeared Its been less than a week and Im already feeling so much more confident I know itll take time for everything to fade but I have faith now I had a crazy amount of acne at one point due to hormone imbalance  I couldnt help but pick at my face  I had soooo many scars left over and was really scared theyd stay forever Luckily for me I picked up this product and use it every night  I can genuinely say I love it and will continue to use it for a while My acne scars are basically all gone Had a lot of acne prone skin and was looking for something to help reduce my dark spots and even my skin tone Saw a difference in my skin in about 2 weeks Just ordered a new one hopefully I keep seeing more improvement PLUS little to NO IRRITATION which is always what Im looking for This has always been my favorite It helps the most with my acne and blemishes It does sting a little but I dont mind it Love it Amazing I have brown hyperpigmented skin and this gel lightened a scar on my chin in just a few weeks A friend asked if I had concealer on over it Brown girlstry this I have suffered from acne throughout the years and I am prone to acne scars because I have a tendency to pick at my skin Once I became pregnant the acne worsened and nothing seemed to work I read all the reviews and was hesitant because of the price but I tried it and within two weeks a majority of my scars disappeared I added photos of before and after only two weeks of use This stuff is great for everyone The timeresults ratio is different for everyone Mine took like 2 weeks but it does lighten the scarring considerably Looking forward to getting my next bottle A few months ago I sampled this product and in desperation decided to buy the full size and give it a try I know its a bit spendy especially when youre a college student but best decision ever I have had acne scars for as long as I can remember and hadnt found anything that really made a difference until I came across this product It really does give long lasting results and now I swear by it Definitely going to be stocking up on Murad products from now on\\nread more I never had acne until I turned 22 and it was really bad my face was left with stains and I would use so much makeup to cover them up after using this product for 2 weeks my face looks so much better Im in love with this product Omg I love this product I bough this about three weeks ago and at first I was a little skeptic and the price was a little too much but I decided to give it a try anyway I have used several different pricey products for my pimples and pimple scars and nothing really worked until I tried this I wear it every night after I wash my face throughly and in two weeks my face is 95 clear of all my scars and I have not gotten a single new pimple since I started using it This thing really works and i am in love with my face now I dont even wear foundation sometimes because my face looks and feels so amazing and soft Definitely recommend\\nread more Ive tried so many different brighteningscar fading products and this is definitely one of my favorites I had lots of pigmentation along my chinjawline and within a few weeks I noticed a SIGNIFICANT difference I use it AM and PM and only apply the gel to areas that need lightening Amazing product  seriously worth it Wow this product surely does work I think the key is just to be consistent when applying this over whichever spotscar youre trying to fadeget rid of Ive been using it for only a week maybe and Im definitely noticing a difference You have to be patient with hyperpigmentation so I understand I wont see full results for a little while but I know its going to come from using this product So if you have dry dehydrated sensitive skin I highly highly recommend this product  This product wont make your scars fade or even tighten your skin but the vegetable glycerin will provide deep deep moisture Its non sticky and my skin wont feel tight I would use serums oil and moisture but my skin will skill get irritated and dry but this product has changed my skin I dont need to use heavy creams anymore and I just need one serum for aging and sun spots vitamin C I stopped using it for a while thinking that it didnt make a difference but my skin began to crack again that I started to get scars that look like stretch marks on my face from the dryness I know its kinda pricey but its definitely worth it for those who get dehydrated skin no matter what\\nread more Feels great on the skin will continue to use it under the ultra facial cream No scent and very light weight LOVE this product I never had problems with my skin until after pregnancy I tried everything to get my skin under control Nothing worked Products would either dry out my skin or make me break out more This product keeps my skin hydrated without being too heavy It also has left my skin feeling really soft This is my do or die moisturizer So simple and packs a huge punch I use it nightly with my tretinoin cream and it helps keep my face from drying out and I wake up to the most plump face ever I have recommended this to everyone who would listen and never got negative feedback This changed my skin within a week I Live in a cold climate area and this is a must have for me I have dry skin within a week I seen changes to my skin It was smooth Soft and Im getting so many compliments on how much better my skin look The high price is most definitely worth it I have been using this serum for years now and LOVE it I tried less expensive products and havent seen the same smoothness and moisture I get from this one Totally worth it This is hands down the best moisturizer Ive used I originally got it for winter but Im still using it in summer Its light yet powerfully moisturizing I have combination skin and it didnt break me out like the other reviews This serum has changed the texture of my skin I incorporate this serum into my night time routine I used to have small bumps all over my face that you could really see under makeup I was skeptical of this product since its not the cheapest After using this for two to three months the amount of bumps diminished and my foundation is laying out smoother The best my skin has been in years and I think this product helped with that a lot\\nread more My fave serum  and Ive tried a million Cheaper than the Plantscriptions I used to use Definitely notice a more youthful appearance Got used to the siliconelike texture Its gives my skin a perfect balance of moist Ive always been a Kiehls fan but this is by far my favourite facial product The perfect level of hydration Moisturizing but not oily or drying It reminds me of the Chanel hyrda serum or the Kate Summerville wrinkle warrior serummoisturizer My skin is oily and combination during the winter I find it difficult to find a great moisturizer that isnt to thick and isnt too matte Really nice product I love this good for dry skin I use with the Kiehls New Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil during day before moisturizer and makeup Best peeling ever tried great stuff recommended by a friend and I really felt in my skin from the first time I used it I have tried m as my at home facials and this is worth the money My skin feels so smooth and the vitamin C has reduced my dark spots already Love that it is two steps Freshly activated product is the best in my opinion Instant results I use weekly and love the immediate difference I feel each time I use it Very simple two step process Will continue to keep stocked at my house I try to use this once a month as my big physical exfoliation of the month The smell is reminiscent of oranges but isnt overpowering The crystal exfoliator in the jar has a mediumfine grit texture which is nice and uniform throughout I like using a nice facial oil after I use this exfoliator and I find that it sinks into the skin so nicely The one aspect I dont really like is the salicylic activating gel Maybe Im not using enough of it but I dont find that it foams up on my face When I first touch it to the crystals there is a little foaming action but as it try to lightly spread it over my skin the foam pretty much dissipates and Im left with a more opaque crystal mask I do like the results I achieve after each use so I may rebuy this not sure yet\\nread more This duo will treat your skin just right First rub the crystals gently on your face perhaps a firmer touch on problem areas My nose is a bit scarred so I use extra time to gently exfoliate I like to give my hands a quick treatment while Im doing my face After rubbing in crystals put on the second lotion Use about a quarter size Then the magic begins When combined the result will be a warming and soothing lotion I leave on my skin for about 4 or 5 minutes Rinse off and your skin will be smooth and glowing I have super dry skin but this Philosophy duo do not make my face dry at all  It is a great way to refresh your skin and let the real you glow Great product natural ingredients Not perfumed I would reccomend for dry and sensitive skin\\nread more Highly recommend Even first use noticeable difference in smoothness redness and pores Didnt case irritation or peeling What can I say about this peel that others havent already said Yes you see instant results in just one try The first time I used the peel I asked 2 of my friends to join me One friend has dark dark skin the other is a caramel color and I have tan skin with yellow undertones All three of us saw our skin look brighter fresher younger and more dewy just after five minutes The peel got rid of dryness smoothed out the skin and diminished acne scarring My friends both ended buying the product on their own The peel is pricey I got it on sale but its lasted me a long time I will buy again when I run out I cannot recommend this product enough\\nread more Literally saving money from going to a spa I honestly think this is an amazing product I am 34 and I have light hyper pigmentation  uneven texture and my skin is starting to set into maturity This product has helped immensely I use this once a week and I noticed after a month my skin has looked more even and youthful I have been using the same skin regime so I know definately this product has certainly gave it the kick it needed\\nread more I love the scrub and the activator that warms it up and lets you know its working My skin is baby smooth and exceptionally soft after use once a week This is a repeat purchase for me It really is a good as they say My only regret is that I didnt buy this product sooner My skin is the softest its ever been in recent memory Im absolutely floored about how great this product is Omg I love the way it makes my skin look  feel Amazing this product is a hidden gem I have rough patchy discolored skin This works wonders and really does Leaves skin feeling smooth What it does in 3 mins is amazingly fantastic I absolutely love this peel Ive been using it for the past two years I love the fresh lemon scent it has to it because its a light scent Before using this I had so much dry skin on my face After using this Ive noticed immediately that my dry skin was gone This peel strips out some of the moisture in your skin So make sure to use a hydration boosterserum along with a moisturizer right after My skin glows after I use this I am actually excited to reach the weekend so I can do this peeling routine The only down size is its price Otherwise i love this Purchased this amazing product in the month of January early I use it every other day This product truly exceeded my expectations for I am now able to go makeup free with confidence Before using this product I would never even consider going anywhere without some type of tinted product on my face for I had major discoloration due to acne scars And being that Im a person who has NEVER written a product review I just HAD to let others know how super pleased I am with the results Ive achieved from having used this product Will be repurchasing\\nread more I use this 2x3x a month It makes my face soooo glowing and bright instantly My face is silky soft and pores looks smaller I really recommend you to try this Im lucky I purchased this when it was half price Definitely going to purchase more when I run out really great product Ive been using this product casually for years until recently My hyperpigmentation has gotten really bad over the past few months and nothing else Ive tried has made a difference That is until I started using this product twice a week Its only been 2 wks and Im seeing a huge improvement in the clearing of my dark marks and the overall texture and complexion of my skin I honestly cant believe Ive been sleeping on such an amazing miracle product Left alone it would have taken my skin 2 months to clear to this point It took 2 wks Im amazed and elated\\nread more I used this product for about 6 months in conjunction with the dr dennis gross alpha beta peel pads and paulas choice ahabha toner I had dramatic results with this combo I am 45 and have moved on to prescription tretinoin retin a but if you are looking for an over the counter solution for your fine lines and wrinkles I recommend this I used this in the evenings before bed My routine after cleansing was dr dennis gross alpha beta peel on my face paulas choice ahabha on my neck and chest then this serum on both my face and chest\\nread more This is my go to overnight serum I love the creamy texture and my skin loves the way it looks upon wakening Its light enough to layer and better yet it makes my skin feel moisturized without adding additional product I have been using this overnight serum for 4 month and I love it  I am on my late 40 and noticed a huge difference on my skin  No dryness and no peeling  I looove this product It was the first product that I introduced into my skin care routine that showed results with 2 weeks of me using it I would recommend beginners using it every 2 days for beginning to use it every night My skin is sensitive but after having my skin get use to this I will not go back I pair this with PRT unwrinkle night cream and together work wonders I cant live without this Using only for night time Helps keep my acne away as it makes my skin softer and smoother Worth every penny Use with the Gross Alpha Beta Daily Peel for almost magical results My skin is aging dry and somewhat sensitive Ill be 59 in December It was looking tired and was developing wrinkles dark spots and texture from many decades of Gulf Coast Texas sun damage About a month ago I began using the Gross Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel Did the peel for two weeks then started alternating the peel every other night with this ferulic and retinol serum I never use them together on the same day Already the improvement in my skin is AMAZING  its smoother looks healthier and wrinkles and dark spots are diminishing And my face isnt as dry as it was I keep touching my skin because I cant believe how good it feels Cant wait to see how it looks in another month I use these products on my face neck and upper chest as well as dabbing on the back of my hands to get rid of the age spots there The scent of this serum doesnt bother me at all Its from the ferulic acid to me its a very faint somewhat metallic smell Ive smelled that in other skincare lines that used this ingredient Ferulic acid has very strong benefits so the good definitely outweighs any bad Again I dont find the odor offensive at all My only regret is that I didnt find these products sooner Sure theyre not cheap but they definitely deliver\\nread more This is magical Love it so much my cat scratched my neck and this healed it quickly and I didnt scar I can only imagine what its doing to the rest of my face and neck I have used this product for about a month and I think it has a good job eliminating my pores Skin is better hydrated nasolabial lines arent as deep I had lunch with a friend who is a plastic surgeon and he told me the only skin products I really need are a retinol and a good moisturizer Im a product junkie and was skeptical at first Some friends told me a retinol would break out my skin So I went on to Sephora App and found this Retinol and holy moly it delivered instant results It smoothed the bumpy skin on the side of my face within a few days and cleared up old spots The best part is that my skin never broke out The product smells like burnt rubber at first but the smell goes away after its absorbed I am VIB Rouge and buy a lot at Sephora but this will go down as the single best purchase\\nread more Ive been using this for about a week now with the facial cleanser daily peel wipes and moisturizer from the Dr Dennis Gross line and I love it Im already starting to see results Most noticeably the size of my pores has been visibly reduced The beginnings of fine lines on my forehead which prompted the purchase are also starting to fade but will likely need a few more months before full results show Also I havent experienced any skin sensitivity to the product at all This is my first time using retinol which Ive always heard is drying but if anything my skin is more moisturized by using the serum I wake up with a very shiny moisturized face\\nread more I was looking for a overnight serum with retinol and when I tried the sample I fell in love with it I bought and its truly lovely You feel the change in skin immediately smells great pumps more than enough for your whole face  neck and it leaves the skin happy and taken care of I have never experienced such fast results in my life I used a sample I got and my skin has been so out of wack due to all the rainy weather lately I put this on before going to bed and my face looked flawless this morning Like smooth as a babys bottom No texture reduced pimple size This is amazing and I am purchasing ASAP Holy grail product for me Everyone can tell when Im using it or not I love this product very much Very much  Expensive  but it is what it is Amazing for a woman of my age I am 61 I have tried a million creams and treatments for my face I have combination skin with discoloration and uneven texture and tone from bad acne in my 20s Lots of scarring etc 3 weeks of this product and my husband nanny and coworkers have all commented on how much better my skin looks I have never used a product that made such a difference on my skin This is my first time trying this line and I am going to try more I have used other products with ferulic acid before and they were okay but this serum is perfection\\nread more'"
